Please, remove the part that realurl can make a different url when the user is logged in. This information is false and only confuses people. Realurl converts urls provided by TYPO3 as is, without any relation to logged in users. It cannot do anything special if the user is logged in or not.

If TYPO3 did not provide any additional parameters when the user is logged in, realurl cannot do anything special.

If TYPO3 provides additional parameters in the url when the user is logged in, url will be unique also without realurl. So realurl should not be mentioned here at all."

The reference in the skin is a relative one, without HTTP/HTTPS.
The problem might be that the backend (the server on which the website is stored, srv179) is called by the proxy server (srv170) via http

MediaWiki 1.27 has been released and is now available.

h2. Update the server

The update is stalled by the outdated PHP version on the server. Needed is PHP 5.5.9 at least. The update cannot be done before a newer PHP version has been installed. For Debian Squeeze, which is used currently, only PHP 5.4 is available (and also that not from the Debian guys, but only from Dotdeb). PHP 5.5 or newer is not available. Seems like it needs a new OS or a new server.

See #79027.


h2. Update MediaWiki Core and run update.php

Remove old folders (except folder images, our skins and our extensions) and then
cp -r mediawiki-1.27.0/* wiki/
run update.php
=> Done.

(diff mediawiki-1.27.0/ and wiki/).

h2. Update extensions (part 1: extensions from tarball or from mediawiki.org)

h3. Newly bundled for 1.27 (extensions from tarball => update .gitignore)

=> None.

h3. Removed ones (extensions from tarball => update .gitignore)

=> None.

h3. Extensions from mediawiki.org

Update extensions from mediawiki.org.

=> Done.

h2. Relevant changes from the ""mailing list"":https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2016-June/000191.html:

No new details.

https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2016-June/000190.html

* Update index_sso.php according to these changes:
  https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/diffusion/MW/history/REL1_27/maintenance/createAndPromote.php
  (Especially the last 2 ones, where support for AuthManager (namespace MediaWiki\Auth) is added;
  changes e.g. for $user->setPassword($user->randomPassword());.)
  => setPassword() has been deprecated, pending the introduction of AuthManager.
  => User::randomPassword() is deprecated in favor of a new method
     PasswordFactory::generateRandomPasswordString()
  => Are fixed.

* MediaWiki will now auto-create users as necessary, removing the need for
  extensions to do so. An 'autocreateaccount' right is added to allow
  auto-creation when 'createaccount' is not granted to all users.
  => Check, if this means that new users do not have to be added anymore in index_sso.php
     Maybe they still have to, see createAndPromote.php, which adds them itself.
  => Manually adding them is still needed.

* AuthManager is concerned with logging in by supplying credentials
  to Special:UserLogin or the like, and with creating accounts with
  new credentials. This includes the usual username and password form
  => Does our index_sso.php login script still work?!
  => Creation of new and login of existing accounts?
  => Works.

h2. https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.27:

* PHP extensions openssl and/or(?) mcrypt are required. Otherwise login might fail.
  => Only one of them is needed, see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgSessionInsecureSecrets
  => Checked on the commandline: openssl is present, mcrypt is not. Is ok.
  
h2. RELEASE-NOTES-1.27

* Required PHP extensions
** ctype
** iconv
** json
** mbstring (new requirement in 1.27)
** xml
The following PHP extensions are strongly recommended:
** openssl

=> Checked on the commandline: All present/enabled.

* PHP session handling in general ($_SESSION, session_id(), and so on) is
  deprecated. Use MediaWiki\Session\SessionManager instead.

* Two new globals, $wgChangeCredentialsBlacklist and $wgRemoveCredentialsBlacklist
  can be used to prevent the web UI and the API changing certain authentication data.
  => Check, if otherwise changing the information, which the user should _not_ be able
     to change would be changable and prevent this,
     e.g. the email-address, the real name and the username.
  => And for the API: action=resetpassword
  => Prior to allowing any change, this requires the user to enter his password - which he does not know.
  => Is ok.

* The following functions have been removed:
** wfEmptyMsg() was removed
** wfMsgReal() was removed
** wfMsgHtml() was removed
** wfMsg() was removed
Do we use them? If so, update them to whatever is appropriate, maybe with wfMessage().
For replacements see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Messages_API#Help_with_replacing_deprecated_wfMsg.2A_functions
=> Are not used/fixed. Is ok.

h2. Update our skin

Use diff and adjust... Use Git for version control.
Do the changes from inside the Vector repo:
https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-skins-Vector/

""Old branch."":https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-skins-Vector/commits/REL1_26  ""New branch"":https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-skins-Vector/commits/REL1_27?page=4
Relevant are the commits from where the sha1 hashes for the ""same"" commit start becoming different
First one is 2015-09-23 = Add MediaWiki version requirement to skin.json

* $wgPreloadJavaScriptMwUtil was removed (deprecated in 1.26).
  Extensions, skins, gadgets and scripts that use the mediawiki.util module must
  express a dependency on it.
* $wgIncludeLegacyJavaScript, deprecated in MediaWiki 1.26, now defaults false.
  Extensions, skins, gadgets and scripts that need the mediawiki.legacy.wikibits
  module should express a dependency on it.
  => Relevant for the skins? Searchbox overwrite JavaScript?
  => Is working.
  => Open a few pages and check the console for JS errors!
  => Result: No errors.

* Skins and extensions can now use FlexBox mixins (.flex-display(@display: flex)
  and .flex(@grow: 1, @shrink: 1, @width: auto, @order: 1)) in Less to create
  cross-browser-compatible FlexBox rules. Users will still need to add fallback
  float rules or the like for compatibility with IE9- separately.

* User::getSkin() was removed
  => function getSkin is used in several places, but not the function from inside the User class. Is ok.

* Skin update ready?!
  => Compare with live system and check, if everything still looks the same.
  => Is ok.

=> Use Firebug to check for JavaScript errors and other problems (e.g. missing mediawiki.util)!

* Inside the TOC, there is a new space between classes tocnumber and toctext, which is not underlined.
  These are the 5px, where tocnumber has padding-right: 5px;
  => Fix to make line run through again!
     Untested: #toc ul li, .toc ul li {text-decoration: underline;}
  => Also check typo3design!
  => Is also a problem in Vector and will likely be solved there and can then be integrated for us.

h2. Update CSS file(s) of the TYPO3Design skin

Needs ""update"":http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher?useskin=typo3design

=> Update done. Looks good.

h2. Check list at http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher

=> Done, works.


h2. Check sortable tables

E.g. at http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User_talk:Chrissitopher

=> Is ok.

h2. Other stuff, that needs fixes

* The file typo3conf/ext/ter_fe/res/icons/state_stable.gif
  gets requested from typo3.org by something in the Sandbox page, but the file no longer is there.
  => CSS class ""stable_unreviewed""; used in
     TYPO3ExtensionInfo/entities/T3CMSExtensioninfo.php
     TYPO3ExtensionInfo/renderer/T3CMSExtensionRenderer.php
  => Fixed, uses pure CSS with the original colors from TER now.

* Visiting the Sandbox and clicking around a bit in Firebug under Console > All shows
  a number of deprecated messages. E.g.
  Use of ""gM"" is deprecated. Use mw.message( ... ).parse() instead.
  but there is no backtrace...
  => Source might be a page on the wiki, e.g. MediaWiki:Common.js and friends,
     something in the skin or something in an extension.
  => Might be helpful: Firebug, Script tab, open side panel at the right hand side, see the variables...
  => Search a DB dump for hits of these functions then. The text table might have some...
  => Has also been present in MW 1.26 already, most likely not set by any custom code in our installation.
  => Gets added by the MediaWiki Core, includes/OutputPage.php: getJSVars().

* Integrate the fixes in SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi: SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi again:
  New wheel file and change in SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi.lexers.php.
  See https://forge.typo3.org/issues/71852
  => Done.

* Check Sandbox, e.g. highlighted things and fontsize in section ""Code""...
  => Is ok.

* Check, if the implementation of syntax highlighting for custom tags is still working
  (after GeSHi switched to Pygments)
  => Is working.

* Check, if the Special:Preferences page still is styled; changes were in the commit from 2015-11-08.
  Still untested, if the preferences have not been broken = are still styled at all.
  => Styling is ok.


---

h2. Update extensions (part 2)

h3. Our own, custom extensions

* After looking through some extensions, e.g. Collection, UserMerge, ReplaceText, Poem, Syntaxhighlighting
  there most likely really is exactly nothing to do here. Should all work as is.
  => However, still test the extension functions, e.g. presence of the header on exception pages,
     function of the <extension> and <issue> tags and so on...
  => Are ok.


h3. PDF export feature

Check that HTML in the left-hand menu is displayed as it should. Functionality also still needs a test.
=> After upgrade, test on live system.
=> Menu items are still there, but rendering of a page to PDF fails with
   Book rendering failed: There was an error while attempting to render your book.
   See #79038.

h2. Order columns, remove db dumps in home/

=> Is ok.

h2. Remove mediawiki-1.27.1 and mediawiki-1.27.1.tar.gz in /home/wikidev/www


h2. Copy Git repos and restore content

Move repos (skins, extensions) from dev to live and checkout their content.
=> Done.

h2. Transfer changes in LocalSettings.php to live system!

=> Done.

h2. Add changes in index_sso.php
=> Adding a new user to the DB works. Different passwords set for different users?
=> Changing an existing user's realname also works.
=> Add changes to live instance.
=> Done.

h2. Check, if all pages linked in the main menu do still exist, otherwise update menu accordingly (TYPO3Vector + TYPO3Design)

=> Done.


h2. Create local backup and diff of skin files

E.g.
diff -u Vector/skin.json TYPO3Design/skin.json > Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.27.diff
diff -u Vector/Vector.php TYPO3Design/TYPO3Design.php >> Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.27.diff
diff -u Vector/SkinVector.php TYPO3Design/SkinTYPO3Design.php >> Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.27.diff
diff -u Vector/VectorTemplate.php TYPO3Design/TYPO3DesignTemplate.php >> Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.27.diff

diff -u Vector/skin.json TYPO3Vector/skin.json > Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.27.diff
diff -u Vector/Vector.php TYPO3Vector/TYPO3Vector.php >> Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.27.diff
diff -u Vector/SkinVector.php TYPO3Vector/SkinTYPO3Vector.php >> Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.27.diff
diff -u Vector/VectorTemplate.php TYPO3Vector/TYPO3VectorTemplate.php >> Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.27.diff


h2. Locally backup SingleSignOn code

=> No longer needed. Is now part of the daily default backup.

h2. diff wiki and wikidev and incorporate all changes

=> Done.

h2. For after the update

* From the Git repos in extensions/ and skins/, do a checkout of branch 1.27.
  In extensions/ download from mediawiki.org.
  => Done.

* index_sso.php: Additional migration tips:

since @l18n@ (as in @l18n_parent@ and @l18n_diffsource@) is semantically wrong and it is my understanding that recent db tables as well as the Extension Builder use @l10n_parent@ and @l10n_diffsource@, shouldn't this be changed throughout the book, maybe with an aditional note explaining the continuous usage of the old naming in existing tables.

What do you think? I would be willing to pull request those changes, of course.

This is obsolete. The code to handle README.* should be removed. Instead a canonical documentation structure with at least

So the general rules for documentation projects are:

- Documentation projects MUST have the right file structure (= canonical, see above)
- For TYPO3 CMS extensions a preprocessor will create that structure ""on the fly"" when there's only a README. That preprocessor already exists.
- For other projects, like Github projects, nothing be rendered at the moment if there only is a README, as we don't have a preprocessor for those projects at the moment.

71617,Documentation,Bug,"",New,Must have,"Default values not used with new content element by BE-Mod ""New Content Element""",Thomas Wittich,"",2015-11-17 01:21,"","",2015-11-17,2015-11-30,3.00,0,2015-11-17 01:08,"","",-565200,"","","Hi all,

found a bug when adding a new content element by BE-module ""New Content Element"".

Setting:
- Adding the element with the module ""New Content Elemente"" results in field image orientation with odd settings:
  A) Selectbox-icons do not match with Seletbox-options; it's od
  B) Given Defaultvalue in TSConfig-Usergroup is ignored. Same to page ts config
- Using decimated entries in imageorientation by TS config (page):
  TCEFORM.tt_content.imageorient.removeItems = 17, 18
- Using default value on TS User Config
  TCAdefaults.tt_content.layout = 52
  TCAdefaults.tt_content.imageorient = 25

Behavior:
- The settings work when adding new content element by right-click on extisting CE, new CE; the new content element opens directly with type of default CE-type; all default values are correct, image orient selectbox options match the selectbox icons consistently
- The settings work NOT when adding new content by clicking on ""+ content""-button or other ways calling the ""New Content Element""-page allowing the user to select the CE-type by tabs & descriptions & icons; after that, the behavior of image orient is odd: default value is ignored, selectbox option does not match selectbox icons (means: clicking on a selectbox icon brings a different text and icon as selected option => umatching)

--> Strange; 

This avoids consistent usage for predefined author roles / ways of useage: author has to care about image orient and other things."

h2. Update MediaWiki Core and run update.php

Remove old folders (except folder images, our skins and our extensions) and then
cp -r mediawiki-1.26.0/* wiki/
run update.php
=> Done.

(diff mediawiki-1.26.0/ and wiki/).

h2. Update extensions (part 1: extensions from tarball or from mediawiki.org)

h3. Newly bundled for 1.26 (extensions from tarball => update .gitignore)

=> None.

h3. Removed ones (extensions from tarball => update .gitignore)

=> None.

h3. Extensions from mediawiki.org

Update extensions from mediawiki.org.

=> Done.

h2. Relevant changes from the ""mailing list"":https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-l/2015-November/045006.html:

No new details.

h2. https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.26:

* Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi has been rewritten and switched from
  the 3rd party library Geshi to the 3rd party library Pygments. If you
  have modified the CSS output with custom rules, these rules might need
  adjustment.
  See also https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ResourceLoader/Migration_guide_%28users%29#Font_mw-geshi
  The mw-geshi, source-css, source-javascript and related classes no
  longer exist. Related code such as the following can be safely removed.
  => Stylesheets updated.

  Page in the MW namespace MediaWiki:Geshi.css: Remove rules from there!
  => Done.
  
h2. RELEASE-NOTES-1.26

* (T99344) The extension.json schema is now versioned. All extensions
  and skins should set a ""manifest_version"" property corresponding to
  the schema version they were written for. The only supported version
  currently is ""1"".
  => Added.
  => Done.

* (T99084) Extensions can now specify what MediaWiki core versions they
  depend upon.
  => Obviously in json files; other extensions don't do that either. Nothing to do.


h2. Update our skin

Use diff and adjust... Use Git for version control.
Do the changes from inside the Vector repo:
https://git.wikimedia.org/log/mediawiki%2Fskins%2FVector.git

""Old branch."":https://git.wikimedia.org/log/mediawiki%2Fskins%2FVector.git/refs%2Fheads%2FREL1_25  ""New branch"":https://git.wikimedia.org/log/mediawiki%2Fskins%2FVector.git/refs%2Fheads%2FREL1_26 
Relevant are the commits after 2015-04-27.
First one is 2015-04-28 = wfRunHooks() -> Hooks::run()

* I.e. (T65198) Talk page tabs now have a ""rel=discussion"" attribute
  => Done.

* On some pages, e.g. on http://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page&action=history
  the text inside the Search box does no longer get replaced by ""Search TYPO3Wiki"".
  JavaScript console shows this error:
  ReferenceError: $ is not defined
  for header.js line 5 and linksupport.js line 9.
  This is the place, where $ is first used, e.g.
  $(document).ready(function ()
  See http://jquery-howto.blogspot.de/2013/02/referenceerror-jquery-is-not-defined.html
  Although jQuery should be included always, the problem is that jQuery is included using the ResourceLoader
  and this is asynchronous since MediaWiki 1.26. jQuery is not yet available when these scripts are run.
  Solution: Put our scripts in an own ResourceLoader module.
  No need to explicitly set jQuery as dependency of this module as jQuery will _then_ be there anyway.
  => Done.

=> Skin update ready!

h2. Update CSS file(s) of the TYPO3Design skin

Needs ""update"":http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher?useskin=typo3design

=> Done.

h2. Check list at http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher

=> Done.


h2. Update extension inclusion in LocalSettings.php

See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension_registration
See also #67178.
=> Collection still missing, rest done.


h2. Other stuff, that needs fixes

* Special:Search needs fix: It now shows page content hits no longer below pages, but displaced and next to them.
  => Done.

* Sandbox, e.g. section ""Code"": Code it too big.
  Was caused by the CSS in the skin (styles for ""pre"").
  => Fixed.


---

h2. Update extensions (part 2)

h3. Our own, custom extensions

* manifest_version in json files
  => Done.

* Update SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi_Typo3WikiExtension
  => Done, see also #71852.


h3. PDF export feature

=> After upgrade, test on live system.
==> Works, done.



h2. Order columns, remove db dumps in home/

diff -u Vector/VectorTemplate.php TYPO3Vector/TYPO3VectorTemplate.php >> Vector-1.26-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.26.diff


h2. Locally backup SingleSignOn code

=> Done.

h2. For after the update

* Check, if the implementation of syntax highlighting for custom tags is still working
  (after GeSHi switched to Pygments)
  => PHP, CSS and SQL are still working.
  ==> For TypoScript (<TS> tag) see #71852.

I think it would be better to first show the file before such an action (the fork) is taken. When the file is displayed, there's still an edit button visible in GitHub (""Fork this project and edit the file"").

Reason:

- I guess most users get confused with what GitHub is showing.
- It is unclear to the user if he actually is about to change the right file. Instead, the user should be able to check the content he is about to change.
- Forking a repository is an action with a persistent result which I actually would like to avoid without knowing what I'm doing.

All there is to do would be to change ""/edit/"" to ""/blob/"" in the URL. I think it's the same line as here:

(I discussed that with Helmut.)

It is best practice to make sure you always know which values are safe for output to the browser (htmlspecialchars, quoteJS) and which are not. A general rule we follow is to prepare variables in a raw form (putting together a title, a link or similar) and doing the actual encoding/safety later when outputting it.
Example:
  $link = $baseUrl . '?foo=bar';
  $output .= '<a href=""' . htmlspecialchars($link) . '>something</a>';
Even if the same link might be used two or three times, it might still be a good idea to encoding it where the final HTML-code is put together and NOT do it one (""for performance-reasons"") some lines above. The same goes with JS-escaping.

Another thing would be to make sure to typecast an integer-variable to (int) when you add it to HTML-output and not rely on that ""some earlier part"" would have made sure it's only a number."

h2. Update MediaWiki Core and run update.php

Remove old folders (except folder images, our skins and our extensions) and then
cp -r mediawiki-1.25.0/* wiki/
run update.php

(diff mediawiki-1.25.0/ and wiki/).

h2. Update extensions (part 1)

h3. Newly bundled for 1.25

=> None.

h3. Extensions from mediawiki.org

Update extensions from mediawiki.org.

=> Done.

h2. Relevant changes from the ""mailing list"":https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-l/2015-May/044396.html:

* Indicators ? Templates that add icons to the top right corner of the page
(and more) can be updated to use the new page status indicators feature.
=> Integrated into skin.

* Enhanced recent changes ? MediaWiki now uses by default the extended
watchlist and so called enhanced recent changes (preference ""Group changes
by page in recent changes and watchlist""), which also received several
improvements in MediaWiki 1.24 and 1.25 (task 37785). This means that
Special:RecentChanges and Special:Watchlist show all the changes to each
page in a given day, sorted by page rather than chronologically. Changes to
each page are collapsed by default and a compact overview is shown, with
links to collated diffs and counts of each user's actions. Full activity
for an individual page can then be shown with a single click. Users will no
longer need to know in detail how a single change was chosen for display in
order to figure out what else may have happened to the page that day, nor
to scan a long list of non-contiguous lines on the screen in order to get a
complete picture. The change is part of MediaWiki's evolution towards an
interface which is more discoverable and less cluttered by default, while
equally easy to quickly access in full, with the help of JavaScript.
However, the (grouped) layout is an improvement for non-JavaScript users as
well.
=> Works.

* Live preview ? While editing, you're not sure what a wikitext syntax will
produce? That's no longer a problem, now that live preview is no longer
experimental. By enabling the feature in your preferences, MediaWiki will
display the effect of your edits without fully reloading the page, so that
you can quickly correct any mistake.
=> Obviously not yet ready as it by default still is disabled. We leave it that way.

h2. https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.25:

* Hitcounter feature has been removed.
=> No replacement available currently, columns removed.

h2. RELEASE-NOTES-1.25

* Update StartProfiler.php:
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Profiling
  => Done.

* MediaWiki now natively supports page status indicators: icons (or short text
  snippets) usually displayed in the top-right corner of the page. They have
  been in use on Wikipedia for a long time, implemented using templates and CSS
  absolute positioning.
  - Basic wikitext syntax: <indicator name=""foo"">[[File:Foo.svg|20px]]</indicator>
  - Usage instructions: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Page_status_indicators
  - Adjusting custom skins to support indicators:
    https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Skinning#Page_status_indicators
	=> Code integrated into our skins.
	==> Position of the indicators (.mw-indicator and .mw-indicators)
	    collided with our language switch.
		Added a margin-right for the indicators so that they are not displayed on top of the language switch.
		Finally, if at least one indicator is present, .mw-body-content gets moved down a bit.
		We will ignore this for now.
		=> Done.

* Deprecated the "".php5"" file extension entry points and the $wgScriptExtension
  configuration variable. Refer to the "".php"" files instead.
  => RewriteRule added.
  => Done.

* The ""temp"" zone of the upload respository is now considered private. If it
  already exists (such as under the images/ directory), please make sure that
  the directory is not web readable (e.g. via a .htaccess file).
  => Deny from all
  => Done.

h2. Update our skin

Use diff and adjust...
Do the changes from inside the Vector repo:
https://git.wikimedia.org/log/mediawiki%2Fskins%2FVector.git

""Old branch."":https://git.wikimedia.org/log/mediawiki%2Fskins%2FVector.git/refs%2Fheads%2FREL1_24  ""New branch"":https://git.wikimedia.org/log/mediawiki%2Fskins%2FVector.git/refs%2Fheads%2FREL1_25 
Relevant are the commits after 2014-09-20.
First one is 2014-09-22 = Use mw-wiki-logo class instead of inline background-image (which directly got reverted)

* (T58257) Set site logo from mediawiki.skinning.interface module instead of
  inline styles in the HTML.
  => Done, works.

* $wgResourceModuleSkinStyles no longer supports per-module local or remote paths. They
  can only be set for the entire skin.
  => Done.

=> Skin update ready.

h2. Update CSS file(s) of the TYPO3Design skin

Needs ""update"":http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher?useskin=typo3design
=> Done.

h2. Check list at http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher

=> All ok.


h2. Update skin inclusion in LocalSettings.php

See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension_registration
=> Done.

h2. Other stuff, that needs fixes

* Functionalities of almost everything (extensions, display of skin...)
  can be checked on page [[Sandbox]].

* TYPO3Vector: line-height of some elements got bigger.
=> Affected ul and dd elements. Fixed.

---

h2. Update extensions (part 2)

h3. Our own, custom extensions

* Update license-name to ""GPL-2.0+"" and adjust COPYING file (new version).

=> Done.

* We are changing the way extensions and skins are registered with MediaWiki.
Extensions and skins can now move their metadata into extension.json or skin.json,
and use wfLoadExtension( 'FooBar' ); or wfLoadSkin( 'FooBar' ); to load those that support it.
All extensions and skins bundled with the tarball support this. The old style of loading
by require_once ""$IP/extensions/FooBar/FooBar.php""; will continue to be supported
for backwards-compatability.
Developer documentation on how to migrate extensions can be found at
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension_registration
=> Extensions converted to extension.json files, still loaded through require_once() calls.
=> Done.




h3. PDF export feature

Check that HTML in the left-hand menu is displayed as it should. Functionality also still needs a test.
=> After upgrade, test on live system.




h2. Order columns, remove db dumps in home/

Table hitcounter is gone,
page: page_counter is gone.
site_stats: ss_total_views is gone.
=> Done.

h2. Commit changes to git repos

Move repos (skins, extensions) from dev to live and restore their content.
=> Done.

h2. Transfer changes in LocalSettings.php to live system!

=> Done.

h2. Check, if all pages linked in the main menu do still exist, therwise update menu accordingly (TYPO3Vector + TYPO3Design)

=> All ok.


h2. Create local backup and diff of skin files

E.g.
diff -u Vector/skin.json TYPO3Design/skin.json > Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.25.diff
diff -u Vector/Vector.php TYPO3Design/TYPO3Design.php >> Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.25.diff
diff -u Vector/SkinVector.php TYPO3Design/SkinTYPO3Design.php >> Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.25.diff
diff -u Vector/VectorTemplate.php TYPO3Design/TYPO3DesignTemplate.php >> Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.25.diff

diff -u Vector/skin.json TYPO3Vector/skin.json > Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.25.diff
diff -u Vector/Vector.php TYPO3Vector/TYPO3Vector.php >> Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.25.diff
diff -u Vector/SkinVector.php TYPO3Vector/SkinTYPO3Vector.php >> Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.25.diff
diff -u Vector/VectorTemplate.php TYPO3Vector/TYPO3VectorTemplate.php >> Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.25.diff

Unfortunately, I am not a lawyer and I can't assess the pros and cons and impacts. Additionally, it looks like nobody is really interested in following up on this or can provide good advices.

Nevertheless, I dare to ask the question again: should we simply correct the links and stick with the Open Content License or should be consider choosing a new license?"

1. Set TER=1 in cron_rebuild.conf for the TER extensions. This should be easy as it's rather centralized.

2. Over time add TER=0 in the cron_rebuild.conf files of regular projects though this is technically not needed. But it's good for clarification and documentation.

Nothing is wrong with that, but I wonder if we should expand the code example, so that is also covers strings in GET/POST requests and also describe to parse/inject the argument properly and securily.

I am thinking about a code fragment, Jigal van Hemert posted in the English mailing list [2] in December 2014:

<pre>lib.products = CONTENT
lib.products{
	table = TABLE
	select {
		selectFields = name
		pidInList = 26506
		orderBy = name
		where = sid like ###GPSID###
		markers {
			GPSID.data = GP:SID
		}
	}
	renderObj = COA
	renderObj {
		10  = COA
		10  {
			10 = TEXT
			10.dataWrap ={field:name}[\n]
		}
	}
}</pre>

If someone is interested and has the time to re-work the code snippet and add the ""argument as string"" example, knock yourself out :-)
The main point of the code above is that by using markers, values get escaped and quoted automatically if required.

All good.

h2. https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.24:

* Redirect to Special:UserLogin when logging in is required to proceed, instead of showing an error message
=> E.g. http://wiki.typo3.org/Special:Watchlist
=> Redirects to http://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Special%3AWatchlist&returntoquery=&warning=watchlistanontext
=> Update .htaccess redirect so that these URLs are redirected to typo3.org as well!
=> Added this RewriteRule:
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} (?:^|&)title=Special:UserLogin(?:&|$) [NC]
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} (?:^|&)returnto=([^&]+) [NC]
RewriteRule index\.php$ https://typo3.org/my-account/sso/wiki/?returnTo=%1 [R=301,L]
==> Done.

* https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T41035
Improved Vector skin performance by removing collapsibleNav, which used to collapse some sidebar elements by default. This removes -list id suffixes like p-lang-list: instead of using things like #p-lang-list, you can do #p-lang .body ul. If you would like CollapsibleNav back please use the CollapsibleVector extension.
=> Done.

* Upgrade jQuery to version 1.11.x
=> JavaScript things in skin still working?
==> Is ok.

* File Wiki.php is missing => Has been renamed to MediaWiki.php, see https://git.wikimedia.org/commit/mediawiki%2Fcore.git/aef531f6d4b8eea10a35e2ee4f9bb522665867fa
=> Login works without it as well, but it is referenced in index_sso.php.
==> Fixed.

* Password hashes will automatically be updated as users log in. In addition, there is a maintenance script wrapOldPasswords.php that can wrap all passwords in PBKDF2 (or the hashing algorithm of your choice) if you don't want to wait for your users to log in.
=> Documentation is badly incomplete. Types might be explained in http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgPasswordConfig
=> Do later, issue created: https://forge.typo3.org/issues/63830
=> Done.


h2. RELEASE-NOTES-1.24

* The legacy '''skins/common/''' directory has been emptied and deleted as part of the skin system cleanup. Files that have been present in it have been moved elsewhere or deleted (if they were unused). If you loaded any of these files as part of your custom skin or on-wiki CSS/JS, you should make a copy of the old files in a non-MediaWiki directory.
 - skins/common/commonElements.css  -> 'mediawiki.skinning.elements' module
 - skins/common/commonContent.css   -> 'mediawiki.skinning.content' module
 - skins/common/commonInterface.css -> 'mediawiki.skinning.interface' module
=> The skin uses the modules and no longer accesses the files directly.
=> Is Ok.

Scenario: An instance under load with lots of TS records that are changed on live directly. While this is often an unwanted scenario, it still may happen for ""microsites"" instances - lots of sites with small page trees. The clearCacheCmd('all') fired by the TypoScript module is then disadvantegous, since it kills way too many cache entries where only entries of the page with the TS record and all its children should be cleared.

The solution to just disable the page clear however is not sufficient, since caches of subpages are not cleared, so the proposed solution is only useful if pages with a changed TS record have no sub pages.

More general approach: Tag a fe cache entry with its rootline. So if a cache entry belongs to page 42 which is a child of page 23 and that is a child of page 5, then page 42 cache entry would be tagged with ""isChildOf_23"" and ""isChildOf_5"" (or similar). The change the TS module to not fire clearCacheCmd('all'), but clearCacheCmd('cacheTag:isChildOf_5') if TS record of page 5 is changed. clearCacheCmd can do that already. Cache entry for page 23 and 42 would be cleared then. Also flush by tag ""PageId_5"". If done, exactly the correct cache entries would be killed and nothing more.
It may only happen that if you ""flushByTag"" a page that alredy has lots of sub pages takes quite some time, so in this case it may be quicker to just ""flush whole cache"" - this does a truncate on Typo3DbBackend cache and an rm -r on file caches and is much quicker than a lengthy ""delete nearly everything"". So, we'd probably need PageTS that controls the flush behaviour (with default to flushByTag).

Tagging caches in the frontend with its ""rootline"" could be beneficial for other things as well, maybe for the list/page module for example: Eg. storing a record on a storage page X then triggers a ""clear caches of page Y and Z and all their sub pages, which is currently also not possible.

Todo:
Find out if the above solution is sane and do-able.
Add functionality to add ""rootline"" tags to cache_pages in the frontend.
Find out usage of pagesection and see if this one can be tagged as well or if the cache entries are re-used on different pages again - which may torpedo the above idea.
Find a sane pageTS syntax to feed clearCacheCmd with options like 'kill everthing below ""me""' and implement it.
I'm not 100% sure if the above will survive all checks, but it sounds like a good idea to me. Better tagging in the frontend is long overdue anyway and it may help us at other places as well. I've raised some attention towards this issue to some active contributors already (eg. Markus Klein and Helmut Hummel), we think that this issue could probably be solved this way, but at the moment no one is really digging deep into that and actually working on it - this is one reason why an answer took longer, I'm really sorry for that.

Alexander, what do you think, is this a good idea and are you feeling you could dive into this overall topic and search for progress here? I would happily help with providing more information, ideas and technical insights that I have on my radar - eg. I know the caching framework pretty well, but I don't know the FE details on my own without digging myself.

I know that the proposed solution is much more complex than just disabling the clear cache action, but I really think this would go into the right direction. My gut feeling is this would be do-able and won't end in ""complexity hell"", cache_pages should be fine, my only doubts are regarding sub cache layers like pagesection, those should get an eye first.

This is the case for instance when a screenshot is created on a retina-enabled machine such as a recent MBP where PNG screenshots have a native resolution of 144 dpi instead of 72.

When the pixel density is properly stored within the image, pdflatex is using it to properly resize the image accordingly but since #62597 we take for granted that every image is 72 dpi, and resize them to 50%. This makes higher resolution images appear too small.

According to http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Comp/comp.text.tex/2008-05/msg00624.html it should be possible to read the actual image resolution during rendering and change the resize factor dynamically instead of hardcoding it to 50%.

I would recommend to include images whose resolution is > 72 dpi at a 1:1 ratio without any dynamic computation. This would let the user choose the actual resolution (think of 300 dpi images for instance).

**Note 1:** see instructions ""here"":http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2010/02/the-myth-of-dpi/ on how changing the resolution in Photoshop without altering the pixel size.

**Note 2:** Although the previous article states that PNG do not hold dpi, this problem has been found with a PNG, maybe the info is only true if the image was saved for the web in Photoshop."

Any hints?

However, currently images are often displaced by several paragraphs; I even found some, which were displaced for several _pages_.

The generated LaTeX files have figures in them like so:
<pre>
\begin{figure}[htbp]
...
\end{figure}
</pre>

The values behind the word ""figure"" tell the LaTeX renderer how it should render the image:
h=here
t=top of next page
b=bottom of page
p=somewhere later on a page together with other images

All these values do _not_ place the images the way we want. Even only using ""h"" still does not always place the image directly where it belongs. This can also not be fixed by using ""!h"" like so: @\begin{figure}[!h]@. ""!h"" strongly suggests LaTeX to really put the image where it has been found. However, should it for some reason not fit at that exact place, LaTeX will float following text above the image, which again displaces it. 

Using @\begin{figure}[H]@ finally _does_ position images correctly. In my tests this was the _only_ way to get images placed properly (tested with the CoreAPIReference). 

This value can be set in conf.py in the latex_elements section:
<pre>
'figure_align': 'H'
</pre>
""Docs"":http://sphinx.readthedocs.org/en/latest/config.html#options-for-latex-output

In order for this option (""H"") to work, we need to use the package ""float"" in the tex file like so:
<pre>
\usepackage{float}
</pre>

However, our version of sphinx (version 1.2pre) does not yet support the ""figure_align"" option. We will have to update sphinx to a current version in order to get support for it. ""This is the commit we want."":https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/commits/0f18c81b53fcaa4db81afaa2d5cf7c32edde93b9 (not yet released)

In the meantime we can fix this by modifying the generated tex file, e.g. with @sed@ from inside cron_rebuild.sh:
<pre>
    sed -i"""" 's/\\usepackage{typo3}/\\usepackage{float}\n\\usepackage{typo3}/' $BUILDDIR/latex/$PROJECT.tex

For my eyes the readability of the result - also in printing - is absolutely ok. 

Readability for printing optionally could be improved by setting @ocgcolorlinks@ for the hyperlinks package like so:
<pre>
\usepackage[ocgcolorlinks]{hyperref}
</pre>

This option could then be given when loading hyperref. Note that you cannot give it in \hypersetup. However, in _my_ opinion setting @ocgcolorlinks@ is not necessary at all.

It creates links to ChapterName/Index.html#anchor-name (and to the according .rst file). Appending the anchor-name is correct, however, for the singlehtml version the *file* of the link target (ChapterName/Index.html) is wrong; the linked files do not exist there. 
Instead the links should always point to the central Index.html file. The link to the rst file (which points to the _source/ folder) should be removed; the singlehtml version does not come with a _source/ folder currently.

For the PDF version neither the target in the source files nor in the PDF is linked; either fix the links to point to the accoring label in the PDF (more or less like the TOC does) or I would tend to just leaving the directive out in the PDF files. Or maybe better (given that the _chapter_ will be there anyway) only put a sentence like ""An overview of the labels for cross linking can be found here: "" and then the URL to the online documentation in its default version.

I have tested the problem and I think this can be fixed by ?simply? adding the correct ids/classes to the HTML code (with other words: the CSS needed for the styling is already there and no change is needed at that point).

In the ?ordinary? page versions (e.g. http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/InstallationGuide/ ) this is what the HTML code looks like:

<pre>
<ul id=""nav-aside"" class=""cnt-2"">
<li class=""toctree-l1 nav-aside-lvl1 cnt-3"">
<a class=""cnt-5 nav-aside-lvl1 reference internal"" href=""Introduction/Index.html"">Introduction</a>
</li>
<li class=""toctree-l1 nav-aside-lvl1 cnt-6"">
<a class=""cnt-8 nav-aside-lvl1 reference internal"" href=""QuickInstall/Index.html"">Introduction</a>
</li>
</pre>
The result of this HTML is styled correctly.


In the singlehtml/ version however, (e.g. http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/InstallationGuide/singlehtml/ ) this in contrast is the HTML code (note the missing classes):
<pre>
<ul>
<li class=""toctree-l1"">
<a class=""reference internal"" href=""Index.html#document-Introduction/Index"">Introduction</a>
</li>
<li class=""toctree-l1"">
<a class=""reference internal"" href=""Index.html#document-QuickInstall/Index"">Quick Installation</a>
</li>
</pre>
The result is unstyled.

I could fix this by adding exactly three things:
Add to the ul tag: id=""nav-aside"" and
Add to each li tag the class: ""nav-aside-lvl1"" and
Add to each a tag the class: ""nav-aside-lvl1""

Where and how must these changes be integrated in order to by default become part of all newly generated singlehtml/ versions?

60184,Inside TYPO3,Bug,"",New,Should have,TYPO3 4.5: CSH for FlexForms,Chris topher,"",2014-07-08 14:39,"","",2014-07-08,"","",0,2014-07-08 14:30,"","",1752450,"","","(Text ""by FranÁois"":http://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/index.php?title=Pending_Documentation&diff=54163&oldid=prev .)

CSH for FlexForms is handled more cleanly but requires adjustments. This has an impact in particular for FE plugins. To continue displaying<br> the CSH for their FlexForm, the CSH file must be declared as for other elements, i.e. 
<pre> t3lib_extMgm::addLLrefForTCAdescr('somekey', 'EXT:myext/locallang_csh.xml');</pre> 
The key is defined as follows: 
<pre>[table name].[field name].[DS pointer field 1](.[DS pointer field 2])</pre> 
The table and the field are those where the FlexForm is used. In most cases this will be ""tt_content.pi_flexform"". The next elements of the key (still separated with dots) are the values of the field or fields (there may be only one) defined in the ""ds_pointerField"" property for the TCA of the FlexForm field. In the case of plugin options, the ""ds_pointerField"" property is set to ""list_type,CType"", so the key would be of the form:<br> 
<pre>tt_content.pi_flexform.[value of list_type field].list
</pre> 
""list"" being the value of the CType field for a FE plugin. To give a complete example, let's assume that the plugin used is from the ""comments"" extension, the full key will be:<br> 
<pre>tt_content.pi_flexform.comments_pi1.list
</pre> 
because ""comments_pi1"" is the value found in the field ""list_type"" when using the plugin provided by the ""comments"" extension. So the ""comments"" extension would use the following call to register its FlexForm CSH:<br> 
<pre>t3lib_extMgm::addLLrefForTCAdescr('tt_content.pi_flexform.comments_pi1.list', 'EXT:comments/pi1/locallang_csh.xml');
</pre> 
With this new method, it is not necessary anymore to point to the CSH&nbsp;file from within the FlexForm's DS, though the ""cshFile"" tag should be left for compatibility with older versions of TYPO3. 

On top of the above, it is advised (but not required) to use the ""alttitle"" in the CSH structure intensively, as it will improve the information displayed in the help pop-up window. In particular, don't forget to define the ""general alttitle"" which is used at the top of the window. Example: 
<pre>&lt;label index="".alttitle""&gt;My plugin's cool configuration options&lt;/label&gt;</pre>

3. The recommended intersphinx mappings are kept as 'intersphinx_mapping_RECOMMENDED' so we have them in the right form at hand where they are needed.

4. For LaTeX-Pdf generation the settings 'latex_documents' and 'latex_elements' are added. Thus ""make latexpdf"" will work out of the box if LaTeX ist available on the system. 'latex_documents' should be filled with the specific values for the specific manual to specify the title, author and output filename and to override the generic values.

Skin autodiscovery ""has been deprecated"":https://git.wikimedia.org/commitdiff/mediawiki%2Fcore.git/7f6834cb67fe916142a074b4076b1bc01990dec3 in MediaWiki 1.23 and will be removed in future versions of MediaWiki. In MediaWiki 1.23 (1.23.0 at least) our base skin Vector has _not_ yet been updated accordingly.

See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Skin_autodiscovery for a guide.

*Once the MediaWiki guys _did_ update Vector, incorporate this update into our skins. Likely this will just be a part of the usual skin update for MediaWiki 1.24 or 1.25.*

Also take care to put ResourceLoader settings such as @$wgResourceModules['skins.myskin.styles']@ and @$wgResourceModules['skins.myskin.js']@ out of LocalSettings.php to the right place somewhere in the PHP files of the skin. Are changes needed?
Same for the inclusion of i18n files such as @$wgExtensionMessagesFiles['MySkin'] = $IP . '/skins/myskin/MySkin.i18n.php'@ and the lines for the JSON files.

A number of patch sets (not necessarily all relevant for adjusting the skins accordingly) can be found here: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Separating_skins_from_core_MediaWiki

*Workaround:* The file includes/Skin.php, function getSkinNames() can be edited and 'TYPO3Vector', 'TYPO3Design' be added to the list of skins, which should not throw an error.

---

Sidenote: Text labels, which have the same name (= array key) in different skins are now always using that text, which got defined first. The text, which got defined at the second/third... place, is no longer used. Reason is that currently the messages of _all_ custom skins are _always_ loaded. I think this will _not_ be fixed when the @$wgMessageDirs['YourExtension']@ and @$wgMessagesDirs@ lines are inside the different skins so that they are only included, because also then will _all_ available skins be included all the time (also when they are _not_ used). The MediaWiki devs ""faced the same problem"":https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/142277/ and took the pragmatic solution: They just renamed one of the array keys."

http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.23 looks fine.

...


h2. RELEASE-NOTES-1.23

* Preferences 'watchcreations', 'watchdefault', 'enotifwatchlistpages' (""Add
  pages I create and files I upload to my watchlist"", ""Add pages and files I
  edit to my watchlist"", ""Email me when a page or file on my watchlist is
  changed"") are now enabled by default. In addition new user accounts' personal
  and talk pages are now watched by them by default.
=> Removed the rows, which only contained the default, from the user_properties table.

* The Vector skin's visual treatment of external links has been simplified to a
  single icon (from nine). This should not affect local rules unless they were
  re-using these icons, which have now been deleted.
=> Works for our skin!

* Three new modules intended for use by custom skins were added:
  'mediawiki.skinning.elements', 'mediawiki.skinning.content', and
  'mediawiki.skinning.interface', representing three levels of standard
  MediaWiki styling. Previously skin creators wishing to use them had to refer
  to the file names of appropriate files directly, which is now discouraged.
=> Are now used properly by our skin.

* The modules 'skins.vector' and 'skins.monobook' have been renamed to
  'skins.vector.styles' and 'skins.monobook.styles', respectively,
  and their definition was changed not to include the common*.css files;
  the two skins now load the 'mediawiki.skinning.interface' module instead.
=> Our skin updated accordingly.

* (bug 52815) Preference ""Enable simplified search bar (Vector skin only)""
  was removed.
=> I removed it and the comment from LocalSettings.php.

* BREAKING CHANGE: The automatically-generated function closure with which
  ResourceLoader wraps all modules' JavaScript code now binds the identifier
  names 'jQuery' and '$' to the jQuery object of the version of jQuery that is
  bundled with MediaWiki. If you bind these names to other objects in global
  scope (like Zepto.js or document.querySelectorAll, for example) you will need
  to use different names to or re-bind them at the top of each
  ResourceLoader-loaded module.
=> Might be relevant for the way how our own text is filled into the search box in the upper right hand corner. But works.


h2. Update our skin

Use diff and adjust...

Might also need to update our CSS file because of changes in skins/common/...?

""Old branch."":https://git.wikimedia.org/history/mediawiki%2Fcore.git/6071399737f23bc8adfc7d07ef72883d458d890c/skins  ""New branch"":https://git.wikimedia.org/history/mediawiki%2Fcore.git/23d5d16bf43578399b862b53c1b6c5e55963e9a4/skins Relevant are the commits after 2013-10-16 = 2013-10-16 as first one.

Continue with 2014-03-27 = Typography update to Vector skin
 
skins/vector/screen.less has been split into a number of separate, smaller files. Do so for our skins as well!

For updates needed for skin autodiscovery see #59311.

Change the resourceLoader registration of our skin (again)...
=> LocalSettings.php! Like vector... 

Search results: Colors of Search button and input box.
=> Adjusted.

h2. Other stuff, that needs fixes

* File does not exist: skins/typo3vector/skins, referer: http://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/load.php?... Checking this URL shows that it's most likely screen-hd.less, which is missing. Do other updates first; should fix that automatically then.
** Possibly caused by the hacks with special.preferences.less in LocalSettings.php (and special.preferences.less including wrong files then)?
** Inclusion of the font files was wrong - a path segment got duplicated. Fixed.

* ""Convert i18n.php files to JSON format"":http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Requests_for_comment/Localisation_format, for the extensions and also for the skins and for t3common/.
** Obviously to be done with https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:GenerateJsonI18n.php
** Check that no messages got lost.
** Add the line with @$wgMessageDirs['YourExtension'] = __DIR__ . '/i18n';@ to the extension PHP file.
** Done!
*** Labels, which have the same name (= array key) in different skins are now always using that text, which got defined first. The text, which got defined at the second/third... place, is no longer used. Reason is that currently the messages of _all_ custom skins are _always_ loaded. This will be fixed when the @$wgMessageDirs['YourExtension']@ and @$wgMessagesDirs@ lines are inside the different skins so that they are only included, when the skin is actually used.

h2. Update extensions

Update extensions from mediawiki.org. See #59106.

Newly bundled for 1.23: none

h3. PDF export feature

Check that HTML in the left-hand menu is displayed as it should. Functionality also still needs a test.
Display works, but creating PDFs currently does _not_ work. Other people on the support pages have the same problem; this might be caused by the servers of the PDF conversion provider having problems. Maybe is not caused by anything on our side.

h3. Other extensions

Update them:
* ...



h2. Update CSS file(s) of the typo3design skin

Needs ""update"":http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher?useskin=typo3design



h2. Clean up old files

(diff mediawiki-1.23.0/ and wiki/).

h2. Order columns, remove db dumps in home/


h2. Commit changes to git repos

As a first step the current ""TypoScript syntax-highlighter"":http://forge.typo3.org/projects/tools-rest/repository/revisions/master/entry/ExtendingPygmentsForTYPO3/ should be installable via pip, setup tools or the like.

This would allow external projects to integrate TypoScript syntax-highlighting much easier, simply by issuing a command like:
<pre>
$ easy_install Pygments-Typo3-Lexers
</pre>

The project I'm actively using, which would benefit from this solution: http://nevir.github.io/groc/ 

h1. The Proposal  - Part II:

Later on this separate plugin could get merged directly into _pygments_. Then external _pygments_-related projects and users are able to render syntax-highlighted TypoScript out-of-the-box. The main user of _pygments_ I know for sure is: ""Github"":https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages#defaults ? They are using (at least) _pygments_ to provide syntax-highlighting. A initial hint I stumbled upon is ""published here"":http://www.pocoo.org/#users . I followed this path and had in another project I'm contributing to, the chance to talk to some github-staff, who confirmed my assumption (verbally). They said, that they update their _pygments_ quite frequently, often daily or whenever a new syntax-lexer has been added. Therefore it should not be too difficult to get _TypoScript_- and maybe also _Fluid_-syntax-highlighting support into their platform, as long as we implement it properly and convince ""Georg Brandl"":https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld to merge it into his _pygments_. He (and most other folks from this project) seem to be very kind and will certainly helps us to get this done right. But we should not start empty - and of course we don't need to. I think we need to offer something installable or at least merge-able in order to get them to work with us.

h1. Suggested Solution:

In order to achieve this goal it is necessary to stick to python's and especially _pygments_' development process. Therefore I created ""a new mercurial-based project on bitbucket"":https://bitbucket.org/sjorek/pygments-typo3-lexers that currently contains everything I found and is (if not already, then very soon) installable as suggested in Part I from above. I opened up this project to invite everybody interested to join the discussion and development-process there. I promise to manage this project open, transparent and as often as I can. But I don't want to ?over-pace? the whole process. I'm convinced that I'm a experienced enough Python-, _pygments_ and TYPO3/Flow developer to guide this process - at least I hope so for now. :-)

h1. Open Questions:

# Did I violate any licences by creating the project on bitbucket and distributing the current TypoScript-syntax-highlighter as a installable _pygments_-plugin ?
# Does the project on bitbucket violate any specifications or guidelines ?
# Who developed the current ""TypoScript-syntax-highlighter"":http://forge.typo3.org/projects/tools-rest/repository/revisions/master/entry/ExtendingPygmentsForTYPO3/_incoming/typoscript.py and how can I get in touch with them ? (Who is behind _?Donation Based Hosting?_ ?)
# Shall we provide a combined _pygments_-plugin for TypoScript and Fluid or two separate _pygments_-plugins ?
# The current TypoScript-syntax-highlighter seems to be incomplete, right ?
  - The lastest addition to paths is missing, ie.: @TCEFORMS.table.field.""flex-form.sub-path"".?@

h1. Open Tasks:

# Write a simple roadmap
# Invite everybody interested and able to use mercurial to the bitbucket project.



As always I appreciate any feedback I can get here. Please do *not* use the bitbucket issue tracker to discuss this proposal yet. Use bitbucket only it for real code-issues only or better ignore it until we officially decide to use it.

Cheerio + Thx,

http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/TSconfigReference/singlehtml/Index.html#example-for-backend-layout

You write:

""Since TYPO3 6.0 mod.SHARED.colPos_list is no longer working. Instead, use backend layouts.""

Funny...but in your example there is no solution how to hide/deactivate cols in BE-Layouts.

There is only a hint in sourcecode:

<pre>
// Draw the pre-generated header with edit and new buttons if a colPos is assigned.
// If not, a new header without any buttons will be generated.
</pre>

I think it would be good, to add this information also in documentation.

The English version states (in brackets): ?extension is installed but not loaded by default?, which is not 100% accurate. Sentence should read: ?extension is shipped with the core, but not installed by default?.

*Slides 101 and 103:* ?protected? flag is no longer part of a Packages.php
The ?protected? flag is no longer part of a file ?Packages.php?, which means, second bullet point on slide 101 is wrong and should be updated: ?If extension is required, a 'protected' flag is to be set in the composer.json file?. This also results in a code update on slide 103.

*Slide 103:* new code example
The naming of the composer packages has changed and is now prefixed ?typo3/cms-?, rather than ?typo3/cms/?. The updated code example on slide 103 already takes this into account.

*Slide 104:* remove this slide
Slide 104 can be dropped, as file ?Package.php? is now optional (for performance reasons).

*Slide 109:* Controller was renamed to ?LanguageController?
Due to the fact that the controller was renamed to ?LanguageController?, the following two changes should be made:

<pre>?TYPO3\\CMS\\Lang\\Command\\LanguageCommandController?</pre>

Example call is now:

<pre>typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh extbase language:update de,en,fr</pre>

select.pidInList now supports the new values ""root"" and ""-1"".

_Add to documentation_

Since TYPO3 CMS 6.2 it is possible to select records from the root-page level, like from the table ""sys_category"". For this case, it is required that ""root"" is set.
Besides that, version records can be selected directly by setting the value to ""-1"", this allows to directly select workspace versioned records.

Special keyword: ""this"" is replaced with the id of the current page, ""root"" is replaced with the root-page level (records with pid=0)

Example:
<pre>
// Fetching related sys_category records
// stored in the MM intermediate table
10 = CONTENT
10 {
	table = sys_category
	select {
		pidInList = root,-1
		selectFields = sys_category.*
		join = sys_category_record_mm ON sys_category_record_mm.uid_local = sys_category.uid
		where.data = field:_ORIG_uid // field:uid
		where.intval = 1
		where.wrap = sys_category_record_mm.uid_foreign=|
		orderBy = sys_category_record_mm.sorting_foreign
		languageField = sys_category.sys_language_uid
	}

We need to achieve two goals for the landing page then for every page:

h3. 1) Make it look part of the TYPO3 umbrella

# Links to official guides/docs from TYPO3 CMS
# Links to other products such as Neos/Flow/...
# Concept of community extensions

h3. 2) Guide the user

# I'm new to TYPO3, I go there to find help, what to do now? May it be for CMS or Neos or Flow, ...
# I already know a bit TYPO3, I need to have info on topic X or Y
# I'm a developer I need API info (for instance)
# I'm looking for how to use extension X

This has several drawbacks:
* It is rather expensive
* It breaks when the HTML code of the pages changes (like after a Redmine upgrade)

A better possibility is using the ""Rest API of Redmine"":http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Rest_api#Fetching-associated-data. This allows to get the data in a nice format, e.g. as XML or JSON.

Example:

There is data, which has been created _before_ 20060102213759 (2.1.2006). 

h3. Entries in the text table

In the text table, these are text entries with @old_id <= 20962@ (timestamp of the revision with old_id = 20962: 20051021095634). They are _not_ marked as ""utf-8"".
The next entry has old_id = 21714 (timestamp of the associated revision: 20060102213759). This and all newer entries _do have_ the utf-8 flag.

h3. Entries in the archive table

This also needs a check in the archive table:

There are 1258 rows, which do _not_ point to a ar_text_id (ar_text_id IS NULL).

The ""utf-8"" flag is _not_ set in ar_flags.

h2. Second part of the problem

There is data, created until between:

Query:
<code class=""sql"">
 SELECT * FROM revision where
 rev_timestamp > 20090711133645 # = rev_id 46246 - bis dahin ist's defintiv kaputt
 and rev_timestamp < 20090731062345 # = rev_id 46317 - ab da ist's OK
 limit 0, 200;
</code>

Inbetween are 62 revs from 11. July to 31. July.

I pick rev_id 46290; after that Daniel did several changes, which point to updates/bug fixes in the wiki being done. rev_id 46290 (timestamp 20090729151633) is the one I take as border between good and bad revs. 

20090729151633 then also is the border for the value of ar_timestamp in the archive table.


Data older than that shows wrong encoding e.g. in edit comments and such.

The way the encoding is broken is the same here as for the very old data (data created _before_ 20060102213759 = the part affected by problem 1). The fix for this part of the problem must be applied for the very first entries up to 20090729151633.

The fields that need checking (old fields up to date x):
* edit comments
* image descriptions and so on....

h2. Solution approach

A German umlaut ""¸"" is displayed as ""√º"" ""example"":http://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/index.php?limit=50&tagfilter=&title=Special%3AContributions&contribs=user&target=80.219.6.224&namespace=&year=2014&month=-1. 
This problem happens when UTF-8-encoded data is displayed as latin1. However, we _do display_ that data as _UTF-8_, so it must miss one conversion to latin1.
Our content is in columns with binary encoding. This means MySQL functions, which convert encodings won't change anything with it, as - for MySQL - it currently _does not have_ any encoding. Something like the following double-convert can be used to convert them anyway:

<code class=""sql"">
 UPDATE tabelle SET spalte=CONVERT(CONVERT(spalte USING utf8) USING latin1) WHERE xxx_id < xyz;

Description:
MM_oppositeUsage defines an array with maps table names to field names, pointing to possible opposite relations. Since the current relation allows any table, these pointers are checked on creating new MM relations and will apply the MM_match_fields from the accordant opposite configuration. TYPO3 CMS uses this for e.g. sys_category and tt_content relations.

Example:
@

'allowed' => '*',
'MM' => 'tx_myextension_first_second_mm',

Basic idea could be:
* Block a user on typo3.org
* During SSO login transfer the information if the user is blocked to the wiki (exactly as is already done with the user groups)
** If the user is blocked, do one or two API calls and he is blocked in the wiki as well. It only needs to transfer the information, whether the user is blocked on t3o; blocking in the wiki itself can then happen automatically and would not cause any work.
* Another idea would be: Transfer the information if the user is blocked and if so, just do _not_ log him in. As simple as that; with our current setup that will also prevent him from writing stuff in the wiki.
** The easiest solution would probably be not to prevent this problem in the wiki, but already one step before that, on typo3.org. The user should just be blocked there and _before_ any login would be triggered. This has the advantage that code for that is only needed at _one_ place, that is on typo3.org and not in every single site, which is connected. That way blocked users will also be unable to use SSO in order to log in to the connected sites/to _all_ connected sites. "

h2. Check list at http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher

Version number is 1.22.0.

h2. Relevant changes from the ""mailing list"":http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-l/2013-December/042243.html:

* After a successful edit, the confirmation message ""Your edit was saved."" is now shown. Formerly a separate extension (Extension:PostEdit), this feature is now part of the core software. (Bug 48276)

=> Appears at a fiting position; no CSS adjustments necessary.

PHP JSON extension now required

=> Is present

=== Blank system messages must be deleted ===
Blanking a system message (editing it on wiki to remove all content) will no longer restore the default value for the message, but instead make it show as an empty string in the interface (fixing Bug 14176, ""Add ability to disable MediaWiki messages""). If you have blank messages on your wiki (check Special:AllMessages), you must delete them unless you want them to display as empty.

=> Messages ""here"":http://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special%3AAllMessages&prefix=&filter=modified&lang=en&limit=50 checked; everything OK.


h2. RELEASE-NOTES-1.22

* BREAKING CHANGE: The Services_JSON class has been removed. If necessary,
  be sure to upgrade affected extensions at the same time (e.g. Collection).
=> We use the newest version as of yesterday; cannot be tested on the dev system. *Still needs a test on the live system, if it's still working*.

* BREAKING CHANGE: Legacy skins Simple, MySkin, Chick, Standard and Nostalgia
  were all removed. (Nostalgia was moved to an extension.) The SkinLegacy and
  LegacyTemplate classes that supported them were removed as well and are now a
  part of the Nostalgia extension.
=> Seems like our Vector based skin works correctly without that.

* New versions of login (Special:UserLogin) and create account
  (Special:UserLogin/signup) forms using the ""vform"" compact vertical form layout.
  These forms use new messages that assume a ""Help logging in"" link, see
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Page_customizations;
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Account_creation_user_experience/Strings lists the
  message key changes.
=> We do not use these pages. In case they come up at some places, I already added a redirect to the t3o login page.

* mw.util.addPortletLink: Tooltip is no longer required to be plain (without
  an accesskey in it already). As such it now rountrips. Creating a link with a
  message as tooltip, grabbing the title attribute and using it to create
  another portlet will work as expected.
Is that one used when building the menu on the left-hand site? Collection links et all?

* $wgVectorUseIconWatch is now enabled by default.

Our skin uses another variable name, which was not set anyway. If we change nothing it will be FALSE; just as it always has been.

* New rights 'editmyusercss', 'editmyuserjs', 'viewmywatchlist',
  'editmywatchlist', 'viewmyprivateinfo', 'editmyprivateinfo', and
  'editmyoptions' restrict actions that were formerly allowed by default. They
  have been added to the default for $wgGroupPermissions['*'].

=> When they are allowed by default, leaving them that way should be secure.

* (bug 53862) portal-url, currentevents-url and helppage have been removed from the
  default Sidebar.

Check http://wiki.typo3.org/MediaWiki:Sidebar - is irrelevant anyway as only the link in the default sidebar (which we don't use) has been removed; wouldn't even be a problem if we ued these pages: The pages themselves stay unchanged.

* The 'vector-simplesearch' preference is now enabled by default. Previously
  it was only enabled if the Vector extension was installed.

Does not matter for us; our skin does not support this option.

* (bug 47191) Fixed ""Column 'si_title' cannot be part of FULLTEXT index""
  MySQL error when installing using the binary character set option.

DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 is set.

* (bug 50134) Hook functions are no longer required to return a value. When a
  hook function does not return a value (or when it returns an explicit null),
  processing continues. To abort the hook, a hook function must return an
  explicit, boolean false or a string error message. Other falsey values are
  tantamount to a 'return true' in earlier versions of MediaWiki.

Good to know; I always found the need to explicitly put that _return TRUE;_ annoying.


h2. Update our skin

Might also need to update our CSS file because of changes in skins/common/...?

Continue ""here"":https://git.wikimedia.org/history/mediawiki%2Fcore.git/6071399737f23bc8adfc7d07ef72883d458d890c/skins with change from 2013-10-10:
New beta module with new typography styles
Remove the @embed comments. jpg image via _.background-image()_ less statement does not work. MediaWiki calculates the path incorrectly then.
 
skins/vector/screen.css and skins/vector/screen-hd.css have been put to less files. Do so for our skins as well!

<pre>
* Add support for the LESS stylesheet language to ResourceLoader. LESS is a
  stylesheet language that compiles into CSS. ResourceLoader file modules may
  include LESS style files; ResourceLoader will compile these files into CSS
  before sending them to the client.
** The $wgResourceLoaderLESSVars configuration variable is an associative array
   mapping variable names to string CSS values. These variables are considered
   declared for all LESS files. Additional variables may be registered by
   adding keys to the array.
** $wgResourceLoaderLESSFunctions is an associative array of custom LESS
   function names to PHP callables. See <http://leafo.net/lessphp/docs/#custom_functions>
   for more details regarding custom functions.
** $wgResourceLoaderLESSImportPaths is an array of file system paths. Files
   referenced in LESS '@import' statements are looked up here first.</pre>

Good to know.

@$wgResourceLoaderDebug = true;@ in LocalSettings can help to check problems with the ResourceLoader. Another option is to add to the URL _?debug=true_...

Change the resourceLoader registration of our skin (again)...
=> LocalSettings.php! Like vector... Done.

* (bug 658) Converted the table of contents on wiki pages from <table> to <div>
  and adjusted skin CSS accordingly. The CSS was carefully crafted to be
  backwards-compatible in all reasonable cases (uses of the __TOC__ magic word,
  the #toc CSS id and the .toc CSS class). However, particularly bad abuse of
  the id or the class can possibly break.

Our screen.less does not contain definitions, which would need a change now for that.
</pre>


h2. Check, if group autoconfirmed needs updated permissions


This was changed in LocalSettings.php: https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/71536/3/includes/DefaultSettings.php
That way our group should directly have these changed rights as well. We have not modified the default rights for protection/editing of protected pages. Is OK that way.


h2. ""Flyout"" under search box is displaced

The box with the pages, which contain a certain hit, is displaced sometimes (shifted to the left).

Since updating our skin until 2013-10-10 I have not seen that again.

---

h2. Update extensions

Update ...

<pre>
=== Bundled extensions ===

Newly bundled for 1.22:
...

Check the other new extensions, if/how they can be useful for us.
</pre>

h3. PDF export feature

HTML in the left-hand menu is displayed as it should. Functionality still needs a test.

h3. Other extensions

Update them:
* UserMerge

All others are current.

h2. Remove the removed skins from the list of removed skins

LocalSettings.php holds a list with those skins, which shall be removed so that they cannot be selected. However, some of these removed skins have now been removed from MediaWiki so that there is no need to remove them from the list. So remove them.

=> Done.


h2. Update CSS file(s) of the typo3design skin

Needs ""update"":http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher?useskin=typo3design



h2. Clean up old files

(diff mediawiki-1.22.0/ and wiki/).

h2. Order columns, remove db dumps in home/


h2. Commit changes to git repos



h2. Transfer skin AND changes in LocalSettings.php to live system!

1) the slide is +empty+, when the PDF document is generated the first time. If you change to the output directory and run the @pdflatex@ command again, the overview is generated correctly. I assume, because some files are generated at the first run and the second run uses them in order to generate the overview.

This is not a show stopper for the final ""What's New"" versions (in all languages), because we can simply run the LaTeX-to-PDF rendering twice (manually) for the versions, which then get published. However, this means, during development, the slide is empty.

2) if the slide is generated (at the second run), it does not show the TYPO3 ""Share"" font but something like ""Arial"" or so. Also, the alignment looks a little bit weird.

I think, they are 6.2 related and important to highlight to the community (and fit perfectly in the ""What's New"" slides).

In order to make the points suitable for slides and to retain the message which they should transfer, but not overwhelming the target audience, some re-wording was required.

The actions are: contact Ernesto and...

1) request his confirmation, that he agrees on having these points in the ""What's New"" slides for 6.2

2) let someone (Ernesto, too?) confirm that the re-wording is ok and the shortened explanations are valid and correct (especially the point ""TYPO3 6.2 performance"") could be walking on thin ice :-)

*Why only 8 of 10 points?*

The original point 7 in the article (""The backend in 6.2 is completely new"") has been addressed in chapter ""Backend Changes"" anyway. Someone who goes through the ""What's New"" slides should already have a good understanding how the 6.2 backend looks like, so there is no point in repeating this.

My impression of the original point 8 (Jens' talk at T3CON) is, that this intends to address confusions about the wording chosen (""TYPO3 7.0""). It is not heavily 6.2-related and therefore, I decided to exclude this point in the slides.

<pre>
Class names starting with :code:`tx_` are reserved for extensions.
Extension PHP class files must start with :code:`class.tx_` prefix,
followed by the extension key without underscores, another underscore
and the name of the class in lowercase. The file name ends with the
extension :code:`php`. For example, if the extension key is
:code:`test_ext`, the file name will be
:code:`class.tx_testext_myclass.php` and the name of the class will be
:code:`tx_testext_myClass`.
 
User files with these class names are commonly found in the
:code:`typo3conf/ext/` directory. Optionally these files can be
installed to the :code:`typo3/ext/` directory to be shared by many
TYPO3 installations.
</pre>

I guess this is not correct anymore with extbase extensions. For example in ext:news the classes start with Tx_ but the filename don't follow these rule. [2]

The CGL should point out that this rule only applies for PI extensions.

Seems like the new feature about adding new TCA elements isn't well documented, currently.

Changes to 6.2 are:
* Having slots preconfigured in ext_tables isn't required any longer, it's just enough to have proper files placed in Configuration/TCA/{tablename}.php
* They kind of take the place of dynamicConfigFile
* Format is ""return the tca array part of that particular table"" instead of ""just overwrite/merge the $GLOBAL['TCA'] array"".

Maybe this documentation section should clearly point out that it's *only for new TCA objects*. When extending existing tables, like pages, you sill need to have ext_tables.php lines and use the _\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::addFieldsToPalette_ call.

The current documentation sticks to the old fashioned way of always adding tca types to the ext_tables.php.
