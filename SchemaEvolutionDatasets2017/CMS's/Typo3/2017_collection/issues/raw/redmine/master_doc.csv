_The only general way to prevent this is to have a different URL for pages when users are logged in (which the extension ""realurl"" can accomplish)._

Please, remove the part that realurl can make a different url when the user is logged in. This information is false and only confuses people. Realurl converts urls provided by TYPO3 as is, without any relation to logged in users. It cannot do anything special if the user is logged in or not.

If TYPO3 did not provide any additional parameters when the user is logged in, realurl cannot do anything special.

If TYPO3 provides additional parameters in the url when the user is logged in, url will be unique also without realurl. So realurl should not be mentioned here at all."

* Complete content of folder

* Complete content of folder
/var/www/vhosts/wiki.typo3.org/www/wiki/images
=> Content from 7.12. is there.
=> If no changes (file uploads!) in the meantime: Ok. Else: Folder images/ (recursively, but only that folder) has to be copied again, to not lose uploads from the meantime

* Database wikitypo3org
=> Get again from old server and put into MySQL again:
     - on old server, User wikitypo3org: mysqldump wikitypo3org --opt > wikidump.sql
     - on new server, User wiki: scp -p wikitypo3org@wiki.typo3.org:~/wikidump.sql wikidump.sql (temporarily needs a private key on the old server)

* After DB wikitypo3org in its final form is there:
TRUNCATE TABLE `msg_resource`,
TRUNCATE TABLE `msg_resource_links`,
TRUNCATE TABLE `objectcache`,
UPDATE `module_deps` SET `md_deps` = REPLACE ( `md_deps`, '/var/www/vhosts/wiki.typo3.org/www/wiki/', '/home/wiki/www/wiki/' ),
(Table module_deps still contains old paths, which would create PHP errors, if not adjusted manually.)

* Database wikidevtypo3org
=> Dev system with old DB ok.

* New DB of the dev system:
UPDATE `module_deps` SET `md_deps` = REPLACE ( `md_deps`, '/var/www/vhosts/wiki.dev.typo3.org/www/wiki/', '/home/wikidev/www/wiki/' ),
=> For the dev system: Done.

* Additional, empty MySQL database is present: MySQL user ""example"" has access to the DB ""example"":
    mysql -u example -pTHEPASSWORD example
    For the password see LocalSettings.php.

* Daily cronjob /etc/cron.d/wiki-backup, add on new system

=> Add by Michi, 5.12. Works.

* Make sure logrotate is configured to use dateext for additions to filenames
=> Already happens by default

* python is there.

* ImageMagick is still missing
=> Install it, preferred location is /usr/bin/convert
=> Has been installed.

* Test upload of an image in the dev system
=> Are thumbnails getting created?
=> Upload and creation of thumbnails are both working

* Logfiles are not all readable.
Adjust owner or permissions of the files in /home/wiki/log and in /home/wikidev/log!

* wikidev: Fix password protection, it is currently set up somewhere with name ""wikidev DEV"". 
Adjust username and password as in /home/wikidev/htaccesspw.txt
   nginx-reload!
   => https://docs.snowflakeops.ch/5-0-stable/services/website.html#environments

* SSO-Code still needed adjustments, because the IP of the server changed.
Folder /home/wiki/tmp/ still had to be created.

* Headlines no longer are styled in Share-Font
The reference in the skin is a relative one, without HTTP/HTTPS.
The problem might be that the backend (the server on which the website is stored, srv179) is called by the proxy server (srv170) via http
internally => http => the proxy encodes this to https
The webserver maybe thinks the request came via http

76955;wiki.typo3.org;Task;;Resolved;Should have;Update the Wiki to MediaWiki 1.27;Chris topher;Chris topher;19/12/2016 19:14;;;6/7/2016;;;100;6/7/2016 14:30;;;-805400;;;"Update the Wiki to MediaWiki 1.27

MediaWiki 1.27 has been released and is now available.

h2. Update the server

The update is stalled by the outdated PHP version on the server. Needed is PHP 5.5.9 at least. The update cannot be done before a newer PHP version has been installed. For Debian Squeeze, which is used currently, only PHP 5.4 is available (and also that not from the Debian guys, but only from Dotdeb). PHP 5.5 or newer is not available. Seems like it needs a new OS or a new server.

See #79027.


h2. Update MediaWiki Core and run update.php

Remove old folders (except folder images, our skins and our extensions) and then
cp -r mediawiki-1.27.0/* wiki/
run update.php
=> Done.

(diff mediawiki-1.27.0/ and wiki/).

h2. Update extensions (part 1: extensions from tarball or from mediawiki.org)

h3. Newly bundled for 1.27 (extensions from tarball => update .gitignore)

=> None.

h3. Removed ones (extensions from tarball => update .gitignore)

=> None.

h3. Extensions from mediawiki.org

Update extensions from mediawiki.org.

=> Done.

h2. Relevant changes from the ""mailing list"":https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2016-June/000191.html:

No new details.

https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2016-June/000190.html

* Update index_sso.php according to these changes:
  https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/diffusion/MW/history/REL1_27/maintenance/createAndPromote.php
  (Especially the last 2 ones, where support for AuthManager (namespace MediaWiki\Auth) is added,
  changes e.g. for $user->setPassword($user->randomPassword()),.)
  => setPassword() has been deprecated, pending the introduction of AuthManager.
  => User::randomPassword() is deprecated in favor of a new method
     PasswordFactory::generateRandomPasswordString()
  => Are fixed.

* MediaWiki will now auto-create users as necessary, removing the need for
  extensions to do so. An 'autocreateaccount' right is added to allow
  auto-creation when 'createaccount' is not granted to all users.
  => Check, if this means that new users do not have to be added anymore in index_sso.php
     Maybe they still have to, see createAndPromote.php, which adds them itself.
  => Manually adding them is still needed.

* AuthManager is concerned with logging in by supplying credentials
  to Special:UserLogin or the like, and with creating accounts with
  new credentials. This includes the usual username and password form
  => Does our index_sso.php login script still work?!
  => Creation of new and login of existing accounts?
  => Works.

h2. https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.27:

* PHP extensions openssl and/or(?) mcrypt are required. Otherwise login might fail.
  => Only one of them is needed, see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgSessionInsecureSecrets
  => Checked on the commandline: openssl is present, mcrypt is not. Is ok.
  
h2. RELEASE-NOTES-1.27

* Required PHP extensions
** ctype
** iconv
** json
** mbstring (new requirement in 1.27)
** xml
The following PHP extensions are strongly recommended:
** openssl

=> Checked on the commandline: All present/enabled.

* PHP session handling in general ($_SESSION, session_id(), and so on) is
  deprecated. Use MediaWiki\Session\SessionManager instead.

* Two new globals, $wgChangeCredentialsBlacklist and $wgRemoveCredentialsBlacklist
  can be used to prevent the web UI and the API changing certain authentication data.
  => Check, if otherwise changing the information, which the user should _not_ be able
     to change would be changable and prevent this,
     e.g. the email-address, the real name and the username.
  => And for the API: action=resetpassword
  => Prior to allowing any change, this requires the user to enter his password - which he does not know.
  => Is ok.

* The following functions have been removed:
** wfEmptyMsg() was removed
** wfMsgReal() was removed
** wfMsgHtml() was removed
** wfMsg() was removed
Do we use them? If so, update them to whatever is appropriate, maybe with wfMessage().
For replacements see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Messages_API#Help_with_replacing_deprecated_wfMsg.2A_functions
=> Are not used/fixed. Is ok.

h2. Update our skin

Use diff and adjust... Use Git for version control.
Do the changes from inside the Vector repo:
https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-skins-Vector/

""Old branch."":https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-skins-Vector/commits/REL1_26  ""New branch"":https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-skins-Vector/commits/REL1_27?page=4
Relevant are the commits from where the sha1 hashes for the ""same"" commit start becoming different
First one is 2015-09-23 = Add MediaWiki version requirement to skin.json

* $wgPreloadJavaScriptMwUtil was removed (deprecated in 1.26).
  Extensions, skins, gadgets and scripts that use the mediawiki.util module must
  express a dependency on it.
* $wgIncludeLegacyJavaScript, deprecated in MediaWiki 1.26, now defaults false.
  Extensions, skins, gadgets and scripts that need the mediawiki.legacy.wikibits
  module should express a dependency on it.
  => Relevant for the skins? Searchbox overwrite JavaScript?
  => Is working.
  => Open a few pages and check the console for JS errors!
  => Result: No errors.

* Skins and extensions can now use FlexBox mixins (.flex-display(@display: flex)
  and .flex(@grow: 1, @shrink: 1, @width: auto, @order: 1)) in Less to create
  cross-browser-compatible FlexBox rules. Users will still need to add fallback
  float rules or the like for compatibility with IE9- separately.

* User::getSkin() was removed
  => function getSkin is used in several places, but not the function from inside the User class. Is ok.

* Skin update ready?!
  => Compare with live system and check, if everything still looks the same.
  => Is ok.

=> Use Firebug to check for JavaScript errors and other problems (e.g. missing mediawiki.util)!

* Inside the TOC, there is a new space between classes tocnumber and toctext, which is not underlined.
  These are the 5px, where tocnumber has padding-right: 5px,
  => Fix to make line run through again!
     Untested: #toc ul li, .toc ul li {text-decoration: underline,}
  => Also check typo3design!
  => Is also a problem in Vector and will likely be solved there and can then be integrated for us.

h2. Update CSS file(s) of the TYPO3Design skin

Needs ""update"":http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher?useskin=typo3design

=> Update done. Looks good.

h2. Check list at http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher

=> Done, works.


h2. Check sortable tables

E.g. at http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User_talk:Chrissitopher

=> Is ok.

h2. Other stuff, that needs fixes

* The file typo3conf/ext/ter_fe/res/icons/state_stable.gif
  gets requested from typo3.org by something in the Sandbox page, but the file no longer is there.
  => CSS class ""stable_unreviewed"", used in
     TYPO3ExtensionInfo/entities/T3CMSExtensioninfo.php
     TYPO3ExtensionInfo/renderer/T3CMSExtensionRenderer.php
  => Fixed, uses pure CSS with the original colors from TER now.

* Visiting the Sandbox and clicking around a bit in Firebug under Console > All shows
  a number of deprecated messages. E.g.
  Use of ""gM"" is deprecated. Use mw.message( ... ).parse() instead.
  but there is no backtrace...
  => Source might be a page on the wiki, e.g. MediaWiki:Common.js and friends,
     something in the skin or something in an extension.
  => Might be helpful: Firebug, Script tab, open side panel at the right hand side, see the variables...
  => Search a DB dump for hits of these functions then. The text table might have some...
  => Has also been present in MW 1.26 already, most likely not set by any custom code in our installation.
  => Gets added by the MediaWiki Core, includes/OutputPage.php: getJSVars().

* Integrate the fixes in SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi: SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi again:
  New wheel file and change in SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi.lexers.php.
  See https://forge.typo3.org/issues/71852
  => Done.

* Check Sandbox, e.g. highlighted things and fontsize in section ""Code""...
  => Is ok.

* Check, if the implementation of syntax highlighting for custom tags is still working
  (after GeSHi switched to Pygments)
  => Is working.

* Check, if the Special:Preferences page still is styled, changes were in the commit from 2015-11-08.
  Still untested, if the preferences have not been broken = are still styled at all.
  => Styling is ok.


---

h2. Update extensions (part 2)

h3. Our own, custom extensions

* After looking through some extensions, e.g. Collection, UserMerge, ReplaceText, Poem, Syntaxhighlighting
  there most likely really is exactly nothing to do here. Should all work as is.
  => However, still test the extension functions, e.g. presence of the header on exception pages,
     function of the <extension> and <issue> tags and so on...
  => Are ok.


h3. PDF export feature

Check that HTML in the left-hand menu is displayed as it should. Functionality also still needs a test.
=> After upgrade, test on live system.
=> Menu items are still there, but rendering of a page to PDF fails with
   Book rendering failed: There was an error while attempting to render your book.
   See #79038.

h2. Order columns, remove db dumps in home/

=> Is ok.

h2. Remove mediawiki-1.27.1 and mediawiki-1.27.1.tar.gz in /home/wikidev/www


h2. Copy Git repos and restore content

Move repos (skins, extensions) from dev to live and checkout their content.
=> Done.

h2. Transfer changes in LocalSettings.php to live system!

=> Done.

h2. Add changes in index_sso.php
=> Adding a new user to the DB works. Different passwords set for different users?
=> Changing an existing user's realname also works.
=> Add changes to live instance.
=> Done.

h2. Check, if all pages linked in the main menu do still exist, otherwise update menu accordingly (TYPO3Vector + TYPO3Design)

=> Done.


h2. Create local backup and diff of skin files

E.g.
diff -u Vector/skin.json TYPO3Design/skin.json > Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.27.diff
diff -u Vector/Vector.php TYPO3Design/TYPO3Design.php >> Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.27.diff
diff -u Vector/SkinVector.php TYPO3Design/SkinTYPO3Design.php >> Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.27.diff
diff -u Vector/VectorTemplate.php TYPO3Design/TYPO3DesignTemplate.php >> Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.27.diff

diff -u Vector/skin.json TYPO3Vector/skin.json > Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.27.diff
diff -u Vector/Vector.php TYPO3Vector/TYPO3Vector.php >> Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.27.diff
diff -u Vector/SkinVector.php TYPO3Vector/SkinTYPO3Vector.php >> Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.27.diff
diff -u Vector/VectorTemplate.php TYPO3Vector/TYPO3VectorTemplate.php >> Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.27.diff


h2. Locally backup SingleSignOn code

=> No longer needed. Is now part of the daily default backup.

h2. diff wiki and wikidev and incorporate all changes

=> Done.

h2. For after the update

* From the Git repos in extensions/ and skins/, do a checkout of branch 1.27.
  In extensions/ download from mediawiki.org.
  => Done.

* index_sso.php: Additional migration tips:

The actual title is ""Copy pages in drag & drop mode"". The feature title is ""Page module: drag and drop supports copying now"".

Reading only the title, it made me think the page tree support making a copy of a page using drag and drop. However the feature is to be able to create duplicate of content element in the module using drag & drop with CTRL key.

I think the title should be something like ""Pages: copy elements with drag & drop"" or ""Pages: drag & drop can copy elements"""

While it's in general possible to override any icons with hooks like overrideIconOverlay it's much work and I never found any description about that, so I still have to fiddle that out, especially concerning ajax-calls from inside of inherited BE-forms.

An option to assign two different icons where each one is used depending on the perspective, the logic of IRRE would be much more comfortable.

I know it's getting deeper than just skinning, so I don't mind if the issue is sorted somewhere else."

since @l18n@ (as in @l18n_parent@ and @l18n_diffsource@) is semantically wrong and it is my understanding that recent db tables as well as the Extension Builder use @l10n_parent@ and @l10n_diffsource@, shouldn't this be changed throughout the book, maybe with an aditional note explaining the continuous usage of the old naming in existing tables.

What do you think? I would be willing to pull request those changes, of course.

The information on this pages is outdated. As an example, right now, the ""Update Whitespace and indentation section"" reads

> TYPO3 uses tab characters to indent source code. One indentation level is one tab.

This is misleading, as PSR-2 uses whitespaces for indentation.

TypoScript (<TS> tag) is still recognized on Special:Version and text also gets the ""mw-highlight"" class put around it, but it does no longer get highlighted.

Our extension SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi_Typo3WikiExtension uses the language name ""typoscript"" for the highlighting of this tag, but Pygments currently does not know this language name. In fact, it currently does not support TypoScript - no matter with which language name.

Michiel Roos has written a lexer for it: https://github.com/Tuurlijk/Pygments-TypoScript-Lexer

Check https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main/issues/1173/add-typoscript-support, which aims at getting it integrated into Pygments.

contain code to cope with documentation projects that only have a PROJECT/README.* file.

This is obsolete. The code to handle README.* should be removed. Instead a canonical documentation structure with at least

<pre>
PROJECT/Documentation/Index.rst
PROJECT/Documentation/Settings.cfg
</pre>

is required (= canonical structure)

So the general rules for documentation projects are:

- Documentation projects MUST have the right file structure (= canonical, see above)
- For TYPO3 CMS extensions a preprocessor will create that structure ""on the fly"" when there's only a README. That preprocessor already exists.
- For other projects, like Github projects, nothing be rendered at the moment if there only is a README, as we don't have a preprocessor for those projects at the moment.

found a bug when adding a new content element by BE-module ""New Content Element"".

Setting:
- Adding the element with the module ""New Content Elemente"" results in field image orientation with odd settings:
  A) Selectbox-icons do not match with Seletbox-options, it's od
  B) Given Defaultvalue in TSConfig-Usergroup is ignored. Same to page ts config
- Using decimated entries in imageorientation by TS config (page):
  TCEFORM.tt_content.imageorient.removeItems = 17, 18
- Using default value on TS User Config
  TCAdefaults.tt_content.layout = 52
  TCAdefaults.tt_content.imageorient = 25

Behavior:
- The settings work when adding new content element by right-click on extisting CE, new CE, the new content element opens directly with type of default CE-type, all default values are correct, image orient selectbox options match the selectbox icons consistently
- The settings work NOT when adding new content by clicking on ""+ content""-button or other ways calling the ""New Content Element""-page allowing the user to select the CE-type by tabs & descriptions & icons, after that, the behavior of image orient is odd: default value is ignored, selectbox option does not match selectbox icons (means: clicking on a selectbox icon brings a different text and icon as selected option => umatching)

--> Strange, 

This avoids consistent usage for predefined author roles / ways of useage: author has to care about image orient and other things."

h2. Update MediaWiki Core and run update.php

Remove old folders (except folder images, our skins and our extensions) and then
cp -r mediawiki-1.26.0/* wiki/
run update.php
=> Done.

(diff mediawiki-1.26.0/ and wiki/).

h2. Update extensions (part 1: extensions from tarball or from mediawiki.org)

h3. Newly bundled for 1.26 (extensions from tarball => update .gitignore)

=> None.

h3. Removed ones (extensions from tarball => update .gitignore)

=> None.

h3. Extensions from mediawiki.org

Update extensions from mediawiki.org.

=> Done.

h2. Relevant changes from the ""mailing list"":https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-l/2015-November/045006.html:

No new details.

h2. https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.26:

* Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi has been rewritten and switched from
  the 3rd party library Geshi to the 3rd party library Pygments. If you
  have modified the CSS output with custom rules, these rules might need
  adjustment.
  See also https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ResourceLoader/Migration_guide_%28users%29#Font_mw-geshi
  The mw-geshi, source-css, source-javascript and related classes no
  longer exist. Related code such as the following can be safely removed.
  => Stylesheets updated.

  Page in the MW namespace MediaWiki:Geshi.css: Remove rules from there!
  => Done.
  
h2. RELEASE-NOTES-1.26

* (T99344) The extension.json schema is now versioned. All extensions
  and skins should set a ""manifest_version"" property corresponding to
  the schema version they were written for. The only supported version
  currently is ""1"".
  => Added.
  => Done.

* (T99084) Extensions can now specify what MediaWiki core versions they
  depend upon.
  => Obviously in json files, other extensions don't do that either. Nothing to do.


h2. Update our skin

Use diff and adjust... Use Git for version control.
Do the changes from inside the Vector repo:
https://git.wikimedia.org/log/mediawiki%2Fskins%2FVector.git

""Old branch."":https://git.wikimedia.org/log/mediawiki%2Fskins%2FVector.git/refs%2Fheads%2FREL1_25  ""New branch"":https://git.wikimedia.org/log/mediawiki%2Fskins%2FVector.git/refs%2Fheads%2FREL1_26 
Relevant are the commits after 2015-04-27.
First one is 2015-04-28 = wfRunHooks() -> Hooks::run()

* I.e. (T65198) Talk page tabs now have a ""rel=discussion"" attribute
  => Done.

* On some pages, e.g. on http://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page&action=history
  the text inside the Search box does no longer get replaced by ""Search TYPO3Wiki"".
  JavaScript console shows this error:
  ReferenceError: $ is not defined
  for header.js line 5 and linksupport.js line 9.
  This is the place, where $ is first used, e.g.
  $(document).ready(function ()
  See http://jquery-howto.blogspot.de/2013/02/referenceerror-jquery-is-not-defined.html
  Although jQuery should be included always, the problem is that jQuery is included using the ResourceLoader
  and this is asynchronous since MediaWiki 1.26. jQuery is not yet available when these scripts are run.
  Solution: Put our scripts in an own ResourceLoader module.
  No need to explicitly set jQuery as dependency of this module as jQuery will _then_ be there anyway.
  => Done.

=> Skin update ready!

h2. Update CSS file(s) of the TYPO3Design skin

Needs ""update"":http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher?useskin=typo3design

=> Done.

h2. Check list at http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher

=> Done.


h2. Update extension inclusion in LocalSettings.php

See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension_registration
See also #67178.
=> Collection still missing, rest done.


h2. Other stuff, that needs fixes

* Special:Search needs fix: It now shows page content hits no longer below pages, but displaced and next to them.
  => Done.

* Sandbox, e.g. section ""Code"": Code it too big.
  Was caused by the CSS in the skin (styles for ""pre"").
  => Fixed.


---

h2. Update extensions (part 2)

h3. Our own, custom extensions

* manifest_version in json files
  => Done.

* Update SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi_Typo3WikiExtension
  => Done, see also #71852.


h3. PDF export feature

Check that HTML in the left-hand menu is displayed as it should. Functionality also still needs a test.
=> After upgrade, test on live system.
==> Works, done.



h2. Order columns, remove db dumps in home/

=> Done.

h2. Copy Git repos and restore content

Move repos (skins, extensions) from dev to live and checkout their content.
=> Done.

h2. Transfer changes in LocalSettings.php to live system!

=> Done.

h2. Check, if all pages linked in the main menu do still exist, otherwise update menu accordingly (TYPO3Vector + TYPO3Design)

=> Done.


h2. Create local backup and diff of skin files

E.g.
diff -u Vector/skin.json TYPO3Design/skin.json > Vector-1.26-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.26.diff
diff -u Vector/Vector.php TYPO3Design/TYPO3Design.php >> Vector-1.26-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.26.diff

diff -u Vector/VectorTemplate.php TYPO3Vector/TYPO3VectorTemplate.php >> Vector-1.26-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.26.diff


h2. Locally backup SingleSignOn code

=> Done.

h2. For after the update

* Check, if the implementation of syntax highlighting for custom tags is still working
  (after GeSHi switched to Pygments)
  => PHP, CSS and SQL are still working.
  ==> For TypoScript (<TS> tag) see #71852.

<pre>
You need to fork this repository to propose changes.
</pre>

I think it would be better to first show the file before such an action (the fork) is taken. When the file is displayed, there's still an edit button visible in GitHub (""Fork this project and edit the file"").

Reason:

- I guess most users get confused with what GitHub is showing.
- It is unclear to the user if he actually is about to change the right file. Instead, the user should be able to check the content he is about to change.
- Forking a repository is an action with a persistent result which I actually would like to avoid without knowing what I'm doing.

All there is to do would be to change ""/edit/"" to ""/blob/"" in the URL. I think it's the same line as here:

(I discussed that with Helmut.)

It is best practice to make sure you always know which values are safe for output to the browser (htmlspecialchars, quoteJS) and which are not. A general rule we follow is to prepare variables in a raw form (putting together a title, a link or similar) and doing the actual encoding/safety later when outputting it.
Example:
  $link = $baseUrl . '?foo=bar',
  $output .= '<a href=""' . htmlspecialchars($link) . '>something</a>',
Even if the same link might be used two or three times, it might still be a good idea to encoding it where the final HTML-code is put together and NOT do it one (""for performance-reasons"") some lines above. The same goes with JS-escaping.

Another thing would be to make sure to typecast an integer-variable to (int) when you add it to HTML-output and not rely on that ""some earlier part"" would have made sure it's only a number."

        '2', 
        '3',

}

This
<pre>
foreach (array('foo' => 'bar', 'foobaz' => 'bazzy',) as $key => $value) {
    ...
}

should become this:

<pre>
foreach (array(
    'foo' => 'bar', 
    'foobaz' => 'bazzy',
) as $key => $value) {
    ...
}
</pre>

This doesn't make it more readable so I would suggest to disallow these kind of constructs and force a explicit array assigning to a variable. 

I am opting to add a sentence like the following one to the CGL:

_Arrays must be always assigned to a variable before usage._"

h2. Update MediaWiki Core and run update.php

Remove old folders (except folder images, our skins and our extensions) and then
cp -r mediawiki-1.25.0/* wiki/
run update.php

(diff mediawiki-1.25.0/ and wiki/).

h2. Update extensions (part 1)

h3. Newly bundled for 1.25

=> None.

h3. Extensions from mediawiki.org

Update extensions from mediawiki.org.

=> Done.

h2. Relevant changes from the ""mailing list"":https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-l/2015-May/044396.html:

* Indicators ? Templates that add icons to the top right corner of the page
(and more) can be updated to use the new page status indicators feature.
=> Integrated into skin.

* Enhanced recent changes ? MediaWiki now uses by default the extended
watchlist and so called enhanced recent changes (preference ""Group changes
by page in recent changes and watchlist""), which also received several
improvements in MediaWiki 1.24 and 1.25 (task 37785). This means that
Special:RecentChanges and Special:Watchlist show all the changes to each
page in a given day, sorted by page rather than chronologically. Changes to
each page are collapsed by default and a compact overview is shown, with
links to collated diffs and counts of each user's actions. Full activity
for an individual page can then be shown with a single click. Users will no
longer need to know in detail how a single change was chosen for display in
order to figure out what else may have happened to the page that day, nor
to scan a long list of non-contiguous lines on the screen in order to get a
complete picture. The change is part of MediaWiki's evolution towards an
interface which is more discoverable and less cluttered by default, while
equally easy to quickly access in full, with the help of JavaScript.
However, the (grouped) layout is an improvement for non-JavaScript users as
well.
=> Works.

* Live preview ? While editing, you're not sure what a wikitext syntax will
produce? That's no longer a problem, now that live preview is no longer
experimental. By enabling the feature in your preferences, MediaWiki will
display the effect of your edits without fully reloading the page, so that
you can quickly correct any mistake.
=> Obviously not yet ready as it by default still is disabled. We leave it that way.

h2. https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.25:

* Hitcounter feature has been removed.
=> No replacement available currently, columns removed.

h2. RELEASE-NOTES-1.25

* Update StartProfiler.php:
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Profiling
  => Done.

* MediaWiki now natively supports page status indicators: icons (or short text
  snippets) usually displayed in the top-right corner of the page. They have
  been in use on Wikipedia for a long time, implemented using templates and CSS
  absolute positioning.
  - Basic wikitext syntax: <indicator name=""foo"">[[File:Foo.svg|20px]]</indicator>
  - Usage instructions: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Page_status_indicators
  - Adjusting custom skins to support indicators:
    https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Skinning#Page_status_indicators
	=> Code integrated into our skins.
	==> Position of the indicators (.mw-indicator and .mw-indicators)
	    collided with our language switch.
		Added a margin-right for the indicators so that they are not displayed on top of the language switch.
		Finally, if at least one indicator is present, .mw-body-content gets moved down a bit.
		We will ignore this for now.
		=> Done.

* Deprecated the "".php5"" file extension entry points and the $wgScriptExtension
  configuration variable. Refer to the "".php"" files instead.
  => RewriteRule added.
  => Done.

* The ""temp"" zone of the upload respository is now considered private. If it
  already exists (such as under the images/ directory), please make sure that
  the directory is not web readable (e.g. via a .htaccess file).
  => Deny from all
  => Done.

h2. Update our skin

Use diff and adjust...
Do the changes from inside the Vector repo:
https://git.wikimedia.org/log/mediawiki%2Fskins%2FVector.git

""Old branch."":https://git.wikimedia.org/log/mediawiki%2Fskins%2FVector.git/refs%2Fheads%2FREL1_24  ""New branch"":https://git.wikimedia.org/log/mediawiki%2Fskins%2FVector.git/refs%2Fheads%2FREL1_25 
Relevant are the commits after 2014-09-20.
First one is 2014-09-22 = Use mw-wiki-logo class instead of inline background-image (which directly got reverted)

* (T58257) Set site logo from mediawiki.skinning.interface module instead of
  inline styles in the HTML.
  => Done, works.

* $wgResourceModuleSkinStyles no longer supports per-module local or remote paths. They
  can only be set for the entire skin.
  => Done.

=> Skin update ready.

h2. Update CSS file(s) of the TYPO3Design skin

Needs ""update"":http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher?useskin=typo3design
=> Done.

h2. Check list at http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher

=> All ok.


h2. Update skin inclusion in LocalSettings.php

See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension_registration
=> Done.

h2. Other stuff, that needs fixes

* Functionalities of almost everything (extensions, display of skin...)
  can be checked on page [[Sandbox]].

* TYPO3Vector: line-height of some elements got bigger.
=> Affected ul and dd elements. Fixed.

---

h2. Update extensions (part 2)

h3. Our own, custom extensions

* Update license-name to ""GPL-2.0+"" and adjust COPYING file (new version).

=> Done.

* We are changing the way extensions and skins are registered with MediaWiki.
Extensions and skins can now move their metadata into extension.json or skin.json,
and use wfLoadExtension( 'FooBar' ), or wfLoadSkin( 'FooBar' ), to load those that support it.
All extensions and skins bundled with the tarball support this. The old style of loading
by require_once ""$IP/extensions/FooBar/FooBar.php"", will continue to be supported
for backwards-compatability.
Developer documentation on how to migrate extensions can be found at
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension_registration
=> Extensions converted to extension.json files, still loaded through require_once() calls.
=> Done.




h3. PDF export feature

Check that HTML in the left-hand menu is displayed as it should. Functionality also still needs a test.
=> After upgrade, test on live system.




h2. Order columns, remove db dumps in home/

Table hitcounter is gone,
page: page_counter is gone.
site_stats: ss_total_views is gone.
=> Done.

h2. Commit changes to git repos

Move repos (skins, extensions) from dev to live and restore their content.
=> Done.

h2. Transfer changes in LocalSettings.php to live system!

=> Done.

h2. Check, if all pages linked in the main menu do still exist, therwise update menu accordingly (TYPO3Vector + TYPO3Design)

=> All ok.


h2. Create local backup and diff of skin files

E.g.
diff -u Vector/skin.json TYPO3Design/skin.json > Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.25.diff
diff -u Vector/Vector.php TYPO3Design/TYPO3Design.php >> Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.25.diff
diff -u Vector/SkinVector.php TYPO3Design/SkinTYPO3Design.php >> Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.25.diff
diff -u Vector/VectorTemplate.php TYPO3Design/TYPO3DesignTemplate.php >> Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.25.diff

diff -u Vector/skin.json TYPO3Vector/skin.json > Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.25.diff
diff -u Vector/Vector.php TYPO3Vector/TYPO3Vector.php >> Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.25.diff
diff -u Vector/SkinVector.php TYPO3Vector/SkinTYPO3Vector.php >> Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.25.diff
diff -u Vector/VectorTemplate.php TYPO3Vector/TYPO3VectorTemplate.php >> Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.25.diff

We should update all docs and correct the link.

On the other hand, the ""license"" topic of TYPO3 docs pops up every now and then. I have started several discussions around this, because my impression is, that this license is not adequate anymore today (so much has changed in the last few years) and a more modern, contemporary and more established and well-known license should be considered for official TYPO3 docs.

Unfortunately, I am not a lawyer and I can't assess the pros and cons and impacts. Additionally, it looks like nobody is really interested in following up on this or can provide good advices.

Nevertheless, I dare to ask the question again: should we simply correct the links and stick with the Open Content License or should be consider choosing a new license?"

I'm not sure if the TSREF is wrong or if it was missed to remove concatenateJsAndCss from the core.
Is it really deprecated?

The note ...
_""There are no default concatenation handlers, which could do the concatenation. A custom concatenation handler must be provided and registered using $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['FE']['concatenateHandler'].""_

Nothing is wrong with that, but I wonder if we should expand the code example, so that is also covers strings in GET/POST requests and also describe to parse/inject the argument properly and securily.

I am thinking about a code fragment, Jigal van Hemert posted in the English mailing list [2] in December 2014:

<pre>lib.products = CONTENT
lib.products{
	table = TABLE
	select {
		selectFields = name
		pidInList = 26506
		orderBy = name
		where = sid like ###GPSID###
		markers {
			GPSID.data = GP:SID
		}
	}
	renderObj = COA
	renderObj {
		10  = COA
		10  {
			10 = TEXT
			10.dataWrap ={field:name}[\n]
		}
	}
}</pre>

If someone is interested and has the time to re-work the code snippet and add the ""argument as string"" example, knock yourself out :-)
The main point of the code above is that by using markers, values get escaped and quoted automatically if required.

All good.

h2. https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.24:

* Redirect to Special:UserLogin when logging in is required to proceed, instead of showing an error message
=> E.g. http://wiki.typo3.org/Special:Watchlist
=> Redirects to http://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Special%3AWatchlist&returntoquery=&warning=watchlistanontext
=> Update .htaccess redirect so that these URLs are redirected to typo3.org as well!
=> Added this RewriteRule:
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} (?:^|&)title=Special:UserLogin(?:&|$) [NC]
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} (?:^|&)returnto=([^&]+) [NC]
RewriteRule index\.php$ https://typo3.org/my-account/sso/wiki/?returnTo=%1 [R=301,L]
==> Done.

* https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T41035
Improved Vector skin performance by removing collapsibleNav, which used to collapse some sidebar elements by default. This removes -list id suffixes like p-lang-list: instead of using things like #p-lang-list, you can do #p-lang .body ul. If you would like CollapsibleNav back please use the CollapsibleVector extension.
=> Done.

* Upgrade jQuery to version 1.11.x
=> JavaScript things in skin still working?
==> Is ok.

* File Wiki.php is missing => Has been renamed to MediaWiki.php, see https://git.wikimedia.org/commit/mediawiki%2Fcore.git/aef531f6d4b8eea10a35e2ee4f9bb522665867fa
=> Login works without it as well, but it is referenced in index_sso.php.
==> Fixed.

* Password hashes will automatically be updated as users log in. In addition, there is a maintenance script wrapOldPasswords.php that can wrap all passwords in PBKDF2 (or the hashing algorithm of your choice) if you don't want to wait for your users to log in.
=> Documentation is badly incomplete. Types might be explained in http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgPasswordConfig
=> Do later, issue created: https://forge.typo3.org/issues/63830
=> Done.


h2. RELEASE-NOTES-1.24

* The legacy '''skins/common/''' directory has been emptied and deleted as part of the skin system cleanup. Files that have been present in it have been moved elsewhere or deleted (if they were unused). If you loaded any of these files as part of your custom skin or on-wiki CSS/JS, you should make a copy of the old files in a non-MediaWiki directory.
 - skins/common/commonElements.css  -> 'mediawiki.skinning.elements' module
 - skins/common/commonContent.css   -> 'mediawiki.skinning.content' module
 - skins/common/commonInterface.css -> 'mediawiki.skinning.interface' module
=> The skin uses the modules and no longer accesses the files directly.
=> Is Ok.

=> Replace all occurrences of #bodyContent with .mw-body-content - also the one in the comment!
=> Done, but STILL TODO IN LIVE SYSTEM (see changes from December 8th)!

=> On [[MediaWiki:TYPO3Vector.css]] update casing in the path inside the rule from ""typo3vector"" to ""TYPO3Vector""!
=> Done, but STILL TODO IN LIVE SYSTEM (see changes from December 8th)!
==> Done.

Input fields have nasty orange border, e.g. on the special page ""Move page""...
=> Skin update did not fix this. Affects multiline and oneline fields.
=> Caused by .mw-ui-input:focus from components/typo3*.less.
=> Defined in MediaWiki in resources/src/mediawiki.ui/components/input.less.
==> Seems to overwrite the complete content of the file, which is not wanted. Solution?
===> See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgResourceModuleSkinStyles

==> Affected the same way as above.

h2. Update CSS file(s) of the TYPO3Design skin

Needs ""update"":http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher?useskin=typo3design
=> Done.

h2. Check list at http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher

All fine, except this one:
File upload seems to work, but throws this error multiple times:
Warning: is_executable(): open_basedir restriction in effect. File(/bin/bash) is not within the allowed path(s): (list of paths) in includes/GlobalFunctions.php on line 2809
=> Related to thumbnail creation? (Thumbnails did get created...)
==> Workaround: Discussed with the Server Team in ""[Ticket#2014121074000321] Configuration change for the wiki server""
===> Added /bin to open_basedir, documented in https://forge.typo3.org/issues/63819.
===> Done.
==> In order to also work without this config change, this issue aims to fix the problem in MediaWiki: https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T78159
==> Works for us. Done.

h2. Update skin inclusion in LocalSettings.php

#Like so: require_once ""$IP/skins/Vector/Vector.php"",
=> Do that with our skins (and with Vector, which was in wgSkipSkins, but _was_ installed and usable by useskin=vector).
==> Done.

h2. Other stuff, that needs fixes

Main page, box with links to Neos stuff has different line height.
=> .t3sidebar p gives wrong size after #content no longer kicks in.
==> Fixed.

h2. For after the update

New special page, MyLanguages, to redirect users to subpages with localised versions of a page. (Integrated from Extension:Translate)
=> Alternative to our translation system?
==> All unused anyway.

Conditions that depend on client details are unlovely for a number

  of cache entrys per page
* Most usual conditions for specific browsers can nowadays turned into
  conditional CSS includes
* Conditions based on browser or clients on server side are
  bad practice.
* If conditions for specific clients or devices are still needed, they
  should be done with a userFunc condition and a project like WURFL
  that keep the device information more recent than the current core
  code like matching AMIGA
* Setups like reverse proxies give additional headaches with these

Scenario: An instance under load with lots of TS records that are changed on live directly. While this is often an unwanted scenario, it still may happen for ""microsites"" instances - lots of sites with small page trees. The clearCacheCmd('all') fired by the TypoScript module is then disadvantegous, since it kills way too many cache entries where only entries of the page with the TS record and all its children should be cleared.

The solution to just disable the page clear however is not sufficient, since caches of subpages are not cleared, so the proposed solution is only useful if pages with a changed TS record have no sub pages.

More general approach: Tag a fe cache entry with its rootline. So if a cache entry belongs to page 42 which is a child of page 23 and that is a child of page 5, then page 42 cache entry would be tagged with ""isChildOf_23"" and ""isChildOf_5"" (or similar). The change the TS module to not fire clearCacheCmd('all'), but clearCacheCmd('cacheTag:isChildOf_5') if TS record of page 5 is changed. clearCacheCmd can do that already. Cache entry for page 23 and 42 would be cleared then. Also flush by tag ""PageId_5"". If done, exactly the correct cache entries would be killed and nothing more.
It may only happen that if you ""flushByTag"" a page that alredy has lots of sub pages takes quite some time, so in this case it may be quicker to just ""flush whole cache"" - this does a truncate on Typo3DbBackend cache and an rm -r on file caches and is much quicker than a lengthy ""delete nearly everything"". So, we'd probably need PageTS that controls the flush behaviour (with default to flushByTag).

Tagging caches in the frontend with its ""rootline"" could be beneficial for other things as well, maybe for the list/page module for example: Eg. storing a record on a storage page X then triggers a ""clear caches of page Y and Z and all their sub pages, which is currently also not possible.

Todo:
Find out if the above solution is sane and do-able.
Add functionality to add ""rootline"" tags to cache_pages in the frontend.
Find out usage of pagesection and see if this one can be tagged as well or if the cache entries are re-used on different pages again - which may torpedo the above idea.
Find a sane pageTS syntax to feed clearCacheCmd with options like 'kill everthing below ""me""' and implement it.
I'm not 100% sure if the above will survive all checks, but it sounds like a good idea to me. Better tagging in the frontend is long overdue anyway and it may help us at other places as well. I've raised some attention towards this issue to some active contributors already (eg. Markus Klein and Helmut Hummel), we think that this issue could probably be solved this way, but at the moment no one is really digging deep into that and actually working on it - this is one reason why an answer took longer, I'm really sorry for that.

Alexander, what do you think, is this a good idea and are you feeling you could dive into this overall topic and search for progress here? I would happily help with providing more information, ideas and technical insights that I have on my radar - eg. I know the caching framework pretty well, but I don't know the FE details on my own without digging myself.

I know that the proposed solution is much more complex than just disabling the clear cache action, but I really think this would go into the right direction. My gut feeling is this would be do-able and won't end in ""complexity hell"", cache_pages should be fine, my only doubts are regarding sub cache layers like pagesection, those should get an eye first.

This is the case for instance when a screenshot is created on a retina-enabled machine such as a recent MBP where PNG screenshots have a native resolution of 144 dpi instead of 72.

When the pixel density is properly stored within the image, pdflatex is using it to properly resize the image accordingly but since #62597 we take for granted that every image is 72 dpi, and resize them to 50%. This makes higher resolution images appear too small.

According to http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Comp/comp.text.tex/2008-05/msg00624.html it should be possible to read the actual image resolution during rendering and change the resize factor dynamically instead of hardcoding it to 50%.

I would recommend to include images whose resolution is > 72 dpi at a 1:1 ratio without any dynamic computation. This would let the user choose the actual resolution (think of 300 dpi images for instance).

**Note 1:** see instructions ""here"":http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2010/02/the-myth-of-dpi/ on how changing the resolution in Photoshop without altering the pixel size.

**Note 2:** Although the previous article states that PNG do not hold dpi, this problem has been found with a PNG, maybe the info is only true if the image was saved for the web in Photoshop."

However, currently images are often displaced by several paragraphs, I even found some, which were displaced for several _pages_.

The generated LaTeX files have figures in them like so:
<pre>
\begin{figure}[htbp]
...
\end{figure}
</pre>

The values behind the word ""figure"" tell the LaTeX renderer how it should render the image:
h=here
t=top of next page
b=bottom of page
p=somewhere later on a page together with other images

All these values do _not_ place the images the way we want. Even only using ""h"" still does not always place the image directly where it belongs. This can also not be fixed by using ""!h"" like so: @\begin{figure}[!h]@. ""!h"" strongly suggests LaTeX to really put the image where it has been found. However, should it for some reason not fit at that exact place, LaTeX will float following text above the image, which again displaces it. 

Using @\begin{figure}[H]@ finally _does_ position images correctly. In my tests this was the _only_ way to get images placed properly (tested with the CoreAPIReference). 

This value can be set in conf.py in the latex_elements section:
<pre>
'figure_align': 'H'
</pre>
""Docs"":http://sphinx.readthedocs.org/en/latest/config.html#options-for-latex-output

In order for this option (""H"") to work, we need to use the package ""float"" in the tex file like so:
<pre>
\usepackage{float}
</pre>

However, our version of sphinx (version 1.2pre) does not yet support the ""figure_align"" option. We will have to update sphinx to a current version in order to get support for it.

This option could then be given when loading hyperref. Note that you cannot give it in \hypersetup. However, in _my_ opinion setting @ocgcolorlinks@ is not necessary at all.

60870;ReST tools;Bug;;Resolved;Should have;Improve ref-targets-list directive;Chris topher;Chris topher;25/9/2014 16:28;;;9/8/2014;;;100;9/8/2014 15:58;;;-29650;;;"The @..ref-targets-list::@ directive does not work correctly in the singlehtml and PDF versions: 

It creates links to ChapterName/Index.html#anchor-name (and to the according .rst file). Appending the anchor-name is correct, however, for the singlehtml version the *file* of the link target (ChapterName/Index.html) is wrong, the linked files do not exist there. 
Instead the links should always point to the central Index.html file. The link to the rst file (which points to the _source/ folder) should be removed, the singlehtml version does not come with a _source/ folder currently.

For the PDF version neither the target in the source files nor in the PDF is linked, either fix the links to point to the accoring label in the PDF (more or less like the TOC does) or I would tend to just leaving the directive out in the PDF files. Or maybe better (given that the _chapter_ will be there anyway) only put a sentence like ""An overview of the labels for cross linking can be found here: "" and then the URL to the online documentation in its default version.

60828;Documentation Rendering;Task;;Resolved;Should have;Add styling for the left hand side menu in the singlehtml version;Chris topher;Chris topher;6/8/2014 19:23;;;6/8/2014;;;100;6/8/2014 19:07;;;-27600;;;"I had a look at the singlehtml/ version of the manuals and I saw that the left hand side menu is still broken.

I have tested the problem and I think this can be fixed by ?simply? adding the correct ids/classes to the HTML code (with other words: the CSS needed for the styling is already there and no change is needed at that point).

In the ?ordinary? page versions (e.g. http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/InstallationGuide/ ) this is what the HTML code looks like:

<pre>
<ul id=""nav-aside"" class=""cnt-2"">
<li class=""toctree-l1 nav-aside-lvl1 cnt-3"">
<a class=""cnt-5 nav-aside-lvl1 reference internal"" href=""Introduction/Index.html"">Introduction</a>
</li>
<li class=""toctree-l1 nav-aside-lvl1 cnt-6"">
<a class=""cnt-8 nav-aside-lvl1 reference internal"" href=""QuickInstall/Index.html"">Introduction</a>
</li>
</pre>
The result of this HTML is styled correctly.


In the singlehtml/ version however, (e.g. http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/InstallationGuide/singlehtml/ ) this in contrast is the HTML code (note the missing classes):
<pre>
<ul>
<li class=""toctree-l1"">
<a class=""reference internal"" href=""Index.html#document-Introduction/Index"">Introduction</a>
</li>
<li class=""toctree-l1"">
<a class=""reference internal"" href=""Index.html#document-QuickInstall/Index"">Quick Installation</a>
</li>
</pre>
The result is unstyled.

I could fix this by adding exactly three things:
Add to the ul tag: id=""nav-aside"" and
Add to each li tag the class: ""nav-aside-lvl1"" and
Add to each a tag the class: ""nav-aside-lvl1""

Where and how must these changes be integrated in order to by default become part of all newly generated singlehtml/ versions?

60184;Inside TYPO3;Bug;;New;Should have;TYPO3 4.5: CSH for FlexForms;Chris topher;;8/7/2014 14:39;;;8/7/2014;;;0;8/7/2014 14:30;;;1752450;;;"(Text ""by FranÁois"":http://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/index.php?title=Pending_Documentation&diff=54163&oldid=prev .)

CSH for FlexForms is handled more cleanly but requires adjustments. This has an impact in particular for FE plugins. To continue displaying<br> the CSH for their FlexForm, the CSH file must be declared as for other elements, i.e. 
<pre> t3lib_extMgm::addLLrefForTCAdescr('somekey', 'EXT:myext/locallang_csh.xml'),</pre> 
The key is defined as follows: 
<pre>[table name].[field name].[DS pointer field 1](.[DS pointer field 2])</pre> 
The table and the field are those where the FlexForm is used. In most cases this will be ""tt_content.pi_flexform"". The next elements of the key (still separated with dots) are the values of the field or fields (there may be only one) defined in the ""ds_pointerField"" property for the TCA of the FlexForm field. In the case of plugin options, the ""ds_pointerField"" property is set to ""list_type,CType"", so the key would be of the form:<br> 
<pre>tt_content.pi_flexform.[value of list_type field].list
</pre> 
""list"" being the value of the CType field for a FE plugin. To give a complete example, let's assume that the plugin used is from the ""comments"" extension, the full key will be:<br> 
<pre>tt_content.pi_flexform.comments_pi1.list
</pre> 
because ""comments_pi1"" is the value found in the field ""list_type"" when using the plugin provided by the ""comments"" extension. So the ""comments"" extension would use the following call to register its FlexForm CSH:<br> 
<pre>t3lib_extMgm::addLLrefForTCAdescr('tt_content.pi_flexform.comments_pi1.list', 'EXT:comments/pi1/locallang_csh.xml'),
</pre> 
With this new method, it is not necessary anymore to point to the CSH&nbsp,file from within the FlexForm's DS, though the ""cshFile"" tag should be left for compatibility with older versions of TYPO3. 

On top of the above, it is advised (but not required) to use the ""alttitle"" in the CSH structure intensively, as it will improve the information displayed in the help pop-up window. In particular, don't forget to define the ""general alttitle"" which is used at the top of the window. Example: 
<pre>&lt,label index="".alttitle""&gt,My plugin's cool configuration options&lt,/label&gt,</pre>

58698;ReST tools;Feature;;New;Should have;develop pygments TypoScript syntax-highlighter ªplugin´ + develop pygments Fluid-Templating syntax-highlighter plugin;Stephan Jorek;;17/8/2015 7:57;;;11/5/2014;;;0;11/5/2014 15:12;;;1678550;;;"h1. The Proposal - Part I:

As a first step the current ""TypoScript syntax-highlighter"":http://forge.typo3.org/projects/tools-rest/repository/revisions/master/entry/ExtendingPygmentsForTYPO3/ should be installable via pip; setup tools or the like.

This would allow external projects to integrate TypoScript syntax-highlighting much easier; simply by issuing a command like:
<pre>
$ easy_install Pygments-Typo3-Lexers
</pre>

The project I'm actively using; which would benefit from this solution: http://nevir.github.io/groc/ 

h1. The Proposal  - Part II:

Later on this separate plugin could get merged directly into _pygments_. Then external _pygments_-related projects and users are able to render syntax-highlighted TypoScript out-of-the-box. The main user of _pygments_ I know for sure is: ""Github"":https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages#defaults ? They are using (at least) _pygments_ to provide syntax-highlighting. A initial hint I stumbled upon is ""published here"":http://www.pocoo.org/#users . I followed this path and had in another project I'm contributing to; the chance to talk to some github-staff; who confirmed my assumption (verbally). They said; that they update their _pygments_ quite frequently; often daily or whenever a new syntax-lexer has been added. Therefore it should not be too difficult to get _TypoScript_- and maybe also _Fluid_-syntax-highlighting support into their platform; as long as we implement it properly and convince ""Georg Brandl"":https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld to merge it into his _pygments_. He (and most other folks from this project) seem to be very kind and will certainly helps us to get this done right. But we should not start empty - and of course we don't need to. I think we need to offer something installable or at least merge-able in order to get them to work with us.

h1. Suggested Solution:

In order to achieve this goal it is necessary to stick to python's and especially _pygments_' development process. Therefore I created ""a new mercurial-based project on bitbucket"":https://bitbucket.org/sjorek/pygments-typo3-lexers that currently contains everything I found and is (if not already; then very soon) installable as suggested in Part I from above. I opened up this project to invite everybody interested to join the discussion and development-process there. I promise to manage this project open; transparent and as often as I can. But I don't want to ?over-pace? the whole process. I'm convinced that I'm a experienced enough Python-; _pygments_ and TYPO3/Flow developer to guide this process - at least I hope so for now. :-)

h1. Open Questions:

# Did I violate any licences by creating the project on bitbucket and distributing the current TypoScript-syntax-highlighter as a installable _pygments_-plugin ?
# Does the project on bitbucket violate any specifications or guidelines ?
# Who developed the current ""TypoScript-syntax-highlighter"":http://forge.typo3.org/projects/tools-rest/repository/revisions/master/entry/ExtendingPygmentsForTYPO3/_incoming/typoscript.py and how can I get in touch with them ? (Who is behind _?Donation Based Hosting?_ ?)
# Shall we provide a combined _pygments_-plugin for TypoScript and Fluid or two separate _pygments_-plugins ?
# The current TypoScript-syntax-highlighter seems to be incomplete; right ?
  - The lastest addition to paths is missing; ie.: @TCEFORMS.table.field.""flex-form.sub-path"".?@

h1. Open Tasks:

# Write a simple roadmap
# Invite everybody interested and able to use mercurial to the bitbucket project.



As always I appreciate any feedback I can get here. Please do *not* use the bitbucket issue tracker to discuss this proposal yet. Use bitbucket only it for real code-issues only or better ignore it until we officially decide to use it.

Cheerio + Thx;

http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/TSconfigReference/singlehtml/Index.html#example-for-backend-layout

You write:

""Since TYPO3 6.0 mod.SHARED.colPos_list is no longer working. Instead; use backend layouts.""

Funny...but in your example there is no solution how to hide/deactivate cols in BE-Layouts.

There is only a hint in sourcecode:

<pre>
// Draw the pre-generated header with edit and new buttons if a colPos is assigned.
// If not; a new header without any buttons will be generated.
</pre>

I think it would be good; to add this information also in documentation.

Category Registry changes will also be applied after Configuration/TCA/Overrides/ has been processed
so that makeCategorizable calls can now also happen in files in this locations and do not need to stay
in ext_localconf.php where they also would be executed on every request.

Install Tool is based on no framework at all, but it uses Fluid. First bullet point should read ?Re-developed from scratch using Fluid?.

*Slide 19:* Configuration Presets have nothing to do with Application Contexts
Truth is, that the Application Context cannot be set in the Install Tool, only through environment variables. The ?Presets? are just a shortcut for configuring certain TYPO3_CONF_VAR settings. This means, headline and first bullet point are wrong. See attached screenshot for an updated version of the slide (English version).

*Slide 50:* EXT:filemetadata

*Slides 101 and 103:* ?protected? flag is no longer part of a Packages.php
The ?protected? flag is no longer part of a file ?Packages.php?, which means, second bullet point on slide 101 is wrong and should be updated: ?If extension is required, a 'protected' flag is to be set in the composer.json file?. This also results in a code update on slide 103.

Slide 104 can be dropped, as file ?Package.php? is now optional (for performance reasons).

select.pidInList now supports the new values ""root"" and ""-1"".

_Add to documentation_

Since TYPO3 CMS 6.2 it is possible to select records from the root-page level; like from the table ""sys_category"". For this case; it is required that ""root"" is set.
Besides that; version records can be selected directly by setting the value to ""-1""; this allows to directly select workspace versioned records.

Special keyword: ""this"" is replaced with the id of the current page; ""root"" is replaced with the root-page level (records with pid=0)

Example:
<pre>
// Fetching related sys_category records
// stored in the MM intermediate table
10 = CONTENT
10 {
	table = sys_category
	select {
		pidInList = root;-1
		selectFields = sys_category.*
		join = sys_category_record_mm ON sys_category_record_mm.uid_local = sys_category.uid
		where.data = field:_ORIG_uid // field:uid
		where.intval = 1
		where.wrap = sys_category_record_mm.uid_foreign=|
		orderBy = sys_category_record_mm.sorting_foreign
		languageField = sys_category.sys_language_uid
	}

boolean

Description
Escapes content to be used safely inside strings in JavaScript. Characters which can cause problems inside JavaScript strings are replaced with their encoded equivalents.
Passes the content through the core function \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility::quoteJSvalue() but removes the surrounding quotes.

Example:
10 = TEXT
10 {
  data = GP:sWord
  escapeJsValue = 1

The wiki contains old data. Parts of this data use a wrong encoding:

h2. First part of the problem

There is data, which has been created _before_ 20060102213759 (2.1.2006). 

h3. Entries in the text table

In the text table, these are text entries with @old_id <= 20962@ (timestamp of the revision with old_id = 20962: 20051021095634). They are _not_ marked as ""utf-8"".
The next entry has old_id = 21714 (timestamp of the associated revision: 20060102213759). This and all newer entries _do have_ the utf-8 flag.

h3. Entries in the archive table

This also needs a check in the archive table:

There are 1258 rows, which do _not_ point to a ar_text_id (ar_text_id IS NULL).

The ""utf-8"" flag is _not_ set in ar_flags.

h2. Second part of the problem

There is data, created until between:

Query:
<code class=""sql"">
 SELECT * FROM revision where
 rev_timestamp > 20090711133645 # = rev_id 46246 - bis dahin ist's defintiv kaputt
 and rev_timestamp < 20090731062345 # = rev_id 46317 - ab da ist's OK
 limit 0, 200,
</code>

Inbetween are 62 revs from 11. July to 31. July.

I pick rev_id 46290, after that Daniel did several changes, which point to updates/bug fixes in the wiki being done. rev_id 46290 (timestamp 20090729151633) is the one I take as border between good and bad revs. 

20090729151633 then also is the border for the value of ar_timestamp in the archive table.


Data older than that shows wrong encoding e.g. in edit comments and such.

The way the encoding is broken is the same here as for the very old data (data created _before_ 20060102213759 = the part affected by problem 1). The fix for this part of the problem must be applied for the very first entries up to 20090729151633.

The fields that need checking (old fields up to date x):
* edit comments
* image descriptions and so on....

h2. Solution approach

A German umlaut ""¸"" is displayed as ""√º"" ""example"":http://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/index.php?limit=50&tagfilter=&title=Special%3AContributions&contribs=user&target=80.219.6.224&namespace=&year=2014&month=-1. 
This problem happens when UTF-8-encoded data is displayed as latin1. However, we _do display_ that data as _UTF-8_, so it must miss one conversion to latin1.
Our content is in columns with binary encoding. This means MySQL functions, which convert encodings won't change anything with it, as - for MySQL - it currently _does not have_ any encoding. Something like the following double-convert can be used to convert them anyway:

<code class=""sql"">
 UPDATE tabelle SET spalte=CONVERT(CONVERT(spalte USING utf8) USING latin1) WHERE xxx_id < xyz,

New jobs are still being added to the database table ""jobs"", but during normal page requests they are never executed. Their jobs_attempts field is 0, meaning MediaWiki did not try a single time to execute them and they also are not executed over time.

$wgJobRunRate has not been changed (and it worked correctly with the same value before). It is set to 1, meaning _one job_ should be executed per page request.

The problem might be caused by this change: https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#q,ccabd0efb05e,n,z

Setting $wgPhpCli = false, makes the jobs run again, however $wgPhpCli defaults to ""/usr/bin/php"" and PHP 5.3 is available at that location. So this workaround should not be necessary at all."

1) the slide is +empty+, when the PDF document is generated the first time. If you change to the output directory and run the @pdflatex@ command again, the overview is generated correctly. I assume, because some files are generated at the first run and the second run uses them in order to generate the overview.

This is not a show stopper for the final ""What's New"" versions (in all languages), because we can simply run the LaTeX-to-PDF rendering twice (manually) for the versions, which then get published. However, this means, during development, the slide is empty.

2) if the slide is generated (at the second run), it does not show the TYPO3 ""Share"" font but something like ""Arial"" or so. Also, the alignment looks a little bit weird.

We use the LaTeX class *tableofcontents* for generating the chapter overview, so I assume, this needs to be tweaked somehow."

The Install Tool provides a tool to update the TYPO3 Core itself under ""Important Actions"". For this to work; the following setup is required:

* Only works under Unix and MacOS (symlink support)
* typo3_src must be a symlink
* This symlink needs to be writable (and deletable) by the Webserver user
* Document Root needs to be writable
* One path above document root (""../"") needs to be writable (new directories allowed to be created)
* ""tar"" command available for extracting the core package

h3. Disabling the Core Updater

To disable the Core Updater functionality altogether (in order to avoid users using it in the Install Tool; i.e. if you have your own update mechanism); you can set this environment variable:

 TYPO3_DISABLE_CORE_UPDATER=1

For example in Apache:

 SetEnv TYPO3_DISABLE_CORE_UPDATER 1

Seems like the new feature about adding new TCA elements isn't well documented; currently.

Changes to 6.2 are:
* Having slots preconfigured in ext_tables isn't required any longer; it's just enough to have proper files placed in Configuration/TCA/{tablename}.php
* They kind of take the place of dynamicConfigFile
* Format is ""return the tca array part of that particular table"" instead of ""just overwrite/merge the $GLOBAL['TCA'] array"".

Maybe this documentation section should clearly point out that it's *only for new TCA objects*. When extending existing tables; like pages; you sill need to have ext_tables.php lines and use the _\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::addFieldsToPalette_ call.

The current documentation sticks to the old fashioned way of always adding tca types to the ext_tables.php.

And update screenshots (e.g. because of visible version number).

And update these two places on the page In-Depth->The Install Tool, where it suddenly starts speaking about ""if you did *not* use the 1-2-3 installer, then you have to do this and that"" (e.g. fill database tables and create admin user). Remove these notes! The manual currently ""only"" documents starting with the 1-2-3 installer. It does not document starting without it at all! People who want it more detailed can use the 1-2-3 installer and still go into details afterwards, but _first_ we let them use the 1-2-3 installer and that's fine.

1) Improvement: the background color of the admonitions should be set to white. I tested locally and adding ""background-color: #ffffff,"" to "".doc .admonition"". Without this admonitions look weird when on a gray background (which happens inside definition list tables, for example, see http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/TCAReference/Reference/Ctrl/Index.html and search for ""typeicon_column"").

2) Bug fix: the CSS from typo3.org has the following selector:
<pre>
.d ol li {
    position: relative,
    padding-left: 20px,
    list-style: decimal,
}
</pre>
The ""list-style"" breaks nested lists when you switch from OL to UL. This is rather rare, but does happen here, for example: http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/indexed_search/latest/AnalysingIndexedData/Index.html

We need to add something like:
<pre>
.d ol ul li {
    list-style-type: disc
}
</pre>
or remove that weird ""list-style: decimal,"" value.

Furthermore nested lists don't display well due to the fixed padding. We need to add something like:
<pre>
.d ol li li {
    padding-left: 20px,
}
</pre>

I would do this myself, but I couldn't find the CSS files. Are they not stored in Git?"

On occasion of this the ""T3PythonDocBuilder"" was modernized. See the ChangeLog.txt:

2013-06-25

    Add ChangeLog.txt for ./T3PythonDocBuilder.
    Introduce constants.py to keep common constants.
    Bump version number of ooxhtml2rst.py to __version__ = '1.2.0'.

    Refer to ""docs.typo3.org"" instead of ""preview.docs.typo3.org""
    in the template.

    Do not write ""DEFINE SOME TEXTROLES"" any more in each ReST-file.
    Add "".. include:: [../]Includes.txt in each ReST-file.

    Do not create ReST version of type ""flt"" with directive 
    ""..†field-list-table::"" anymore (but still "".. t3-field-list-table::"").

    Prepend all sections with a label. Only sections made up by just
    underlining are covered.
    
    Add the Includes.txt file.
    Add the Targets.rst file.
    
    Tweak the ""dllisttables(.py)"". These are the ""definition list
    structures"" that are produced from the original ""property tables"" of
    the OpenOffice documents. Tweaking means: drop the first table row
    it is meaningless. Add a headline and label for each row.
        
    
2013-05-24 wishlist:

    go through the file structure (starting at Documentation)
    record the depth level
    in each file:
     remove the text role header
     add the include directive (with respect to depth)
     for each section heading
      add a label before it. Base the label on the section heading text.
     read t3-field-list-table structures
     for each such structure
      remove the first row
      for each other row
       repeat the t3-field-list-table declaration
       add a section heading before it (with a label) based on the property's (first field) name

48754;wiki.typo3.org;Bug;;Resolved;Should have;Prevent fatal error during login (SSO);Chris topher;Chris topher;1/6/2013 15:48;;;1/6/2013;;;100;1/6/2013 15:06;;;1187500;;;"Very rarely login does not succeed:

[31-May-2013 14:23:32] PHP Fatal error:  Call to a member function idForName() on a non-object in index_sso.php on line 140

(This problem was already present with MediaWiki 1.20, it is _not_ caused by the update to 1.21.)

Our login script does this:
<code class=""php"">
	$user = User::newFromName($User_Name),
	$id = $user->idForName(), /* line 140 */
</code>

The second line is the one causing the error.

*Background:*

@User::newFromName@ usually returns an object and everything is fine.
But in _some rare cases_ it does _not_ return an object, which then causes the error when trying to do @$user->idForName(),@ (as @$user@ is no object then).
The problematic cases are:
* The username contains ""#""
* The username contains forbidden characters: Certain unicode signs, slashes (would break subpage-concept of MediaWiki), slash-dot-combinations, control characters, the sequence ""~~~""
* The username starts with an interwiki prefix or a namespace, e.g. ""de:xxx"" or ""File:xxx"".
* The user page would not be creatable (reasons partly similar to the ones above), e.g. ""/../"" in a user name would make the user page inaccessable due to the way how browsers handle relative URLs.

*Non-solutions:*

We could start modifying the username in order to make it valid for MediaWiki, but we should not do that. Would we do that, we would have lost: If we modify usernames, we cannot be sure that there is not another user, who already *has* that username. The two would then no longer be distinguishable. They would appear to be one and the same user.

*Solution:*

Make the script not fail with a fatal PHP error, but make it fail at least a bit more gracefully:

<code class=""php"">
$user = User::newFromName( $username ),
if ( !is_object( $user ) ) {
       echo 'Invalid username. We are sorry, but your username cannot be used by MediaWiki. ' .
           'It contains signs/combinations of signs, which cannot be used.',
       die(),
}
$id = $user->idForName(),
</code>

The script is derived from ""createAndPromote.php"":https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/gitweb?p=mediawiki/core.git,a=blob,f=maintenance/createAndPromote.php,h=81fbbb3d3246042ca671b6c4d0ba3f2a2e0204d1,hb=refs/heads/REL1_21.
They basically do the same:
<code class=""php"">
$user = User::newFromName( $username ),
if ( !is_object( $user ) ) {
          $this->error( ""invalid username."", true ),
}

$exists = ( 0 !== $user->idForName() ),
...
</code>
@$this->error( ""invalid username."", true ),@ prints the error message and then calls @die()@ as well."

        # dump the global context
        outfilename = path.join(self.outdir, self.globalcontext_filename)
        self.dump_context(self.globalcontext, outfilename)

        # super here to dump the search index
--> super/self hereafter?
        super.handle_finish(self)

Xcache is an PHP opcode cache similar to APC, the cache can also store in-memory key/value user data.

The cache backend implementation is nearly identical to the implementation of APC backend and has the same design constraints.

Important: xcache does NOT work in CLI PHP SAPI. The xcache backend implementation is constructed to silently discard any cache operation if in CLI context. That means if Xcache backend is used, it is of no effect in CLI. 

Furthermore, it is important to set the PHP ini value xcache.var_size to a value (eg. 100M) that is big enough to store the needed data. The usage of this capacity should be monitored."

Currently for extensions there can only be one segment for the vendor name.

The rule is \<VendorName>\<ExtensionKey>\<Folder1>\<Folder2>\<ClassName>

While the extension key must be transformed from underscores to upper camel case and the folders must reside in a ""Classes"" folder on the top level inside the extension folder and lastly the class file must be named exatly like the class (case sensitive!) with a trailing "".php""

For core classes we built in exceptions in many places; so that we coud use ""TYPO3"" as the vendor and ""CMS"" as the product name; before the segment with the extension key starts. This has been done to not have conflicting namespaces e.g. for Fluid if we would have skipped the product name ""CMS""

Dear Typoscript documentation team,

I was just following your Typoscript in 45 minutes tutorial and found an mistake in an example (or at least it didn't work for me). In the 4th blue code box on the following page: http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/TyposcriptIn45MinutesTutorial/Typoscript-AQuickOverview/FirstSteps/Index.html

The example states the following: 

# <= means that the object is referenced (the object is linked)
 test.value = Holla
 mypage.10 <= test


but instead it should be the following: 

# =< means that the object is referenced (the object is linked)
 test.value = Holla
 mypage.10 =< test

The operator sign <= should be =<. 

Good luck and best regards,
Refik Hadzialic

The remark seems absolutely correct."

Extensions:
This would also be very useful for TER extension documentations.
If the ext developpers needs to fill in this information; I think the documentation would gain more quality.
Imagin an update of your extension to 2.0 but the documentation is still assigned to version 1.4 - you will soon have a issue on forge to update your documentation.

Ok now we have these wrong examples (wrong means, that a comment on the right side is wrong)

Here we are:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dummy.enable = # false, because value is empty
dummy.enable = 0 # false, prefered notation
dummy.enable = 1 # true, prefered notation
dummy.enable = yes # true, because ('yes') is a non empty string and not treated as '0'
dummy.enable = no # true (!), because ('no') is a non empty string and not treated as '0'
dummy.enable = 0 anything # false, because ('0 anything') is treated as '0'
dummy.enable = 1 anything # false, because ('1 anything') is treated as '1'
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the comment of this excample:
dummy.enable = yes # true, because ('yes') is a non empty string and not treated as '0'
says that something is not treated as '0' and thereby this result is told to us:
dummy.enable = true

the comment of the last excample:
dummy.enable = 1 anything # false, because ('1 anything') is treated as '1'
says also that something is not treated as '0' - but another result is told to us:
dummy.enable = false

I repeat my first posting for this issue: 
The comment of the examples before the last one say that something is _true_ when the value is not treated as '0'.
The comment of the last example _still_ says that something is _false_ when the value is not treated as '0' (e.g. when it is treated as '1')
 - so this comment says the opposite of all comments before.

My original intention of closed issue #44813 was not to _reduce_ examples, it was to publish _correct_ examples.

Please do not tell the readers that
dummy.enable = 1 anything 
is 
dummy.enable = false
because it is
dummy.enable = true

The reason is Realurl. Realurl can only resolve paths, which have at least been generated once. The paths to the SSO apps are generated here: typo3.org/my-account/sso/

However, the dev wiki page is not in the menu, so it is not displayed and so the URL is not generated. Always when someone flushes the complete Realurl cache, the login breaks.

The solution is to make the page show up in the menu, open the page and hide it again.

It would be very helpful for editors to see an overview of the labels that are defined in a documentation project.

Here we introduce a new directive which does exactly that. It inserts a list of ref targets into the document. The directive doesn't know any options or parameters:

    .. ref-targets-list::

[Proudly presenting:] This is achieved by the Sphinx extension 't3sphinx.ext.targets'. It is included automatically due to GlobalSettings.py. To achieve that at home you have to reinstall 't3sphinx':

    $ git clone git://git.typo3.org/Documentation/RestTools.git
    $ cd ..../ExtendingSphinxForTYPO3
    $ python setup.py install

I hope I've understood the inner working of Sphinx well enough and everything works as expected. If not - let me know in this bug tracker!

41338;Coding Guidelines;Bug;;Resolved;Should have;Change CGL for inline comments;Stefano Kowalke;;27/10/2012 12:39;;6.0.0;25/9/2012;;;100;25/9/2012 9:10;;;824200;;;"Copy and Paste from Core ML:

<pre>
Hi,

our CGL currently state that inline comments must be indented one tab more than the following code line.

This is a speciality that only exists (as far as I know) in the TYPO3 project for historical reasons.

One downside is, that IDEs lack support for auto formatting the comments that way.

With the switch to namespaces, the script accidently reverted this coding style and set *all* inline comments on the same indenation level as the following code.

During the CI code sprint we discussed if it would make sense to change the CGL here and leave it, as we have it now instead of fixing all the comments.

We all agreed that we should go that way and change the CGLs

Any major downsides to do so?

Kind regards,
Helmut

39834;ReST tools;Major Feature;;Resolved;Should have;"Create Sphinx extension for ""field-list-table"" directive";Martin Bless;Martin Bless;20/8/2012 22:35;;TYPO3 TER & typo3.org integ.;15/8/2012;;;100;15/8/2012 16:05;;;753200;;;"Task: Find a solution for the ""table problem""
=============================================

Writing tables when documenting is generally not easy. ReST has markup constructs named ""simple table""; ""grid table"" and ""csv-table"". None of them really fit our needs as we have big; largely nested tables in our OpenOffice manuals. Often one table cell contains as much text as it makes a complete document elsewhere.

As a possible solution I implemented and proposed an extension to the Docutils (basic ReST tools). Sphinx builds on this and works on top of this. Due to lack of manpower this ""field-list-table"" directive didn't make it into the Docutils core for now and therefore is mostly not available.

Now that we have made a lot of progress with the migration process to ReST in the TYPO3 community we see that rendering will be either done on a TYPO3 server or; if locally as well; always by using Sphinx. That is a good thing; as Sphinx offers an API to hook in Sphinx Extensions.

The current implementation of the ""field-list-table"" directive is entangled with the classes of the Docutils code. But I should be able to change that.

This means:
I'll try to rewrite the ""field-list-table"" directive as Sphinx extension and make that available in our Python package ""t3sphinx"" which does what the folder name says: ""ExtendingSphinxForTypo3""."
39828;ReST tools;Task;;Resolved;Must have;"Create ""standalone"" version of the OpenOffice to ReST (Sphinx structure) converter";Martin Bless;Martin Bless;3/9/2012 16:35;;Workflow automation;15/8/2012;;;100;15/8/2012 13:23;;;752900;;;"There is nearly everything in [1] that we need to have a tool that takes an OpenOffice manual.sxw as input and produces a complete TYPO3 Sphinx project with ReST files.

There is still one issue with the paths to images where you have to intervene manually in the moment.

And we need a commandline interface that accecpts several parameters and options.

Once this is done we should create a Python package for this so that we, let's say, can do:

  $ # grab [1] snapshot
  $ cd [.../] Typo3OpenOfficeToSphinxConverter
  $ python setup.py install

After that ""normal"" (GNU-like) commandline tool 't3sxw2sphinx' should be available.

Now, that's my plan. Sounds good! And should exactly be what Fabien will need to plug in into the PHP/FLOW3 part of the rendering chain.

We sometimes see that system administrators update the TYPO3 core because of a security issue by extracting the new TYPO3 sources, changing the symlink but leaving the sources of the previous TYPO3 version on the system. As a consequence, the insecure code is still accessible and a security vulnerability possibly exploitable. The advice should be that the old (possibly insecure) code should be removed as soon as possible.

The risk is a little bit lower with TYPO3 extensions, because usually EM takes care about the update and replaces the existing directory of the extension. However, I came across servers in the past, where the admin created a backup of the extension directory before updating the extension. So the extension directory looks like:

typoconf/ext/extensionkey
typoconf/ext/extensionkey.bak
typoconf/ext/extensionkey.DELETE_ME
(or similar)

Same issue here... same advice :-)

I found a nice tool for Mac OS X named Dash. http://kapeli.com/dash/
This tool can fetch docsets from an url and provide them offline for developers.
I tried to use this with the api.typo3.org documentations generated with doxygen.
But this doesn't work. After contacting the developer I got the following answer:

I think the only one we have to do, to make the TYPO3-API available for this program is to set the option _GENERATE_DOCSET_ to YES.
Is this possible? I think that's very easy to change."

** *Preventing the problem*: Everything as above, but do _not_ copy to clipboard. Instead in Photoshop *save as PNG*. This file can then be dragged into the document with the mouse or it can be inserted using the Insert > Picture > From File dialogue in Writer. Then the result still is a PNG file."

They say that this temporarily would be a longer problem. If they tried to login again this would again fail. Clearing the browser cache or using another browser would not help. However, if they try some time later (a few weeks or so) login again works. 
This was reported by a user, whose user account has already been created (= already is in the database), browsers used were Firefox and Chrome.

I heard a very similar report from a user, who tried to log in in the wiki for the first time (= whose account was not yet in the DB):
Login on typo3.org worked and redirection back to the wiki happened, however, he was not logged in.
In that case a new user would have had to be created in the DB. I checked that and the new user account had *not* been added.

Account names for example are ""petapico"" (no login with existing account) and ""huaba"" or ""thucke"" (no login and account not created). I have then created the account ""huaba"" manually through MediaWiki (that's why it is present now).

<pre>
Change permissions and ownership of the directories. This usually requires the
""sudo"" command. Assuming that the web server user is in the group named
""apache"", execute the following commands in the web site root directory:
        sudo chgrp -R apache fileadmin typo3temp typo3conf uploads
        sudo chmod -R g+rwX,o-w fileadmin typo3temp typo3conf uploads
</pre>

While that is good advice, the install tool will complain after installation about not being able to write to typo3/ext.

Personally, I use:
<pre>
sudo chgrp --recursive $HTTPD_GROUP $BASE/fileadmin $BASE/typo3temp $BASE/typo3conf $BASE/uploads $BASE/typo3/ext
sudo chmod --recursive g+rwX,o-w $BASE/fileadmin $BASE/typo3temp $BASE/typo3conf $BASE/uploads $BASE/typo3/ext

The commit message already gives a good explaination:

Problem:
* Cacheable content is always page specific.
Pages cannot share cached content.
* Cacheable content has no individual lifetime
but is bound to the lifetime of the page where it is placed.

Solution:
Introduce new configuration options that will store the
content into the caching framework:

Examples:
5 = TEXT
5 {
cache.key = mycurrenttimestamp
cache.tags = tag_a,tag_b,tag_c
cache.lifetime = 3600
data = date : U
strftime = %H:%M:%S
}

or (for page specific cache that doesn't take
other parameters into account)
5 = TEXT
5 {
cache.key = mycurrenttimestamp_{page:id}
cache.key.insertData = 1
}

E.g. t3lib_div::getUserObj produces the debug output
debug(""Class '"" . $class . ""' was not prepended with '"" . $checkPrefix . ""'"", 't3lib_div::getUserObj'),

The developer will add more debug commands when the PHP code is under development.
At the end a tool should help to remove all debug commands. However there are debug commands which should remain and never be removed.

So I need a hint at the end of the debug command.

E.g.

debug(""Class '"" . $class . ""' was not prepended with '"" . $checkPrefix . ""'"", 't3lib_div::getUserObj'), // must remain

or

debug(""Class '"" . $class . ""' was not prepended with '"" . $checkPrefix . ""'"", 't3lib_div::getUserObj'), // %keep

Then a tool could search and remove all debug commands in the PHP code except the line which have the '%keep' at the end.

or use this convention

debug(""* Class '"" . $class . ""' was not prepended with '"" . $checkPrefix . ""'"", 't3lib_div::getUserObj'),
A leading '*' in the debug output means that this is an error debugging."

  20.wrap = This|solution
  20.stdWrap.wrap = &nbsp,|&nbsp,
}
</code></pre>
This results in ""@This is a working solution.@""

The purpose of this property is to allow the integrator to add multiply stdWrap statements without having to remember the rather complex sorting order in which the stdWrap functions are executed.

orderedStdWrap consists of an array of keys (like COA). Each key carries the value of content and then a normal stdWrap is done. So one could think each key as a TEXT object with the value of the current content.

The execution is done in order which means that all keys are first sorted and then process separately.
In this example 10.innerWrap is executed first, followed by 10.wrap.
Then the next key is processed which is 20. Afterwards the 30.wrap is executed on what is already created.

orderedStdWrap returns the content after processing it with each given key.

TCA ['ctrl'] section

The documentation of ""type"" key needs to be extended:

It is also possible to reference fields from related records, i.e. switch by the typeField of a foreign table. For doing so, you can use the syntax relationField:foreignTypeField.

Example: If you have two tables, parent and child table. The child table has a relation to the parent table using a ""select"" field called ""myparent"" with ""foreign_table"" set to the parent table. Now, if you want the fields displayed in the child table to depend on a field called ""parenttype"" on the parent table, you can define the [ctrl][type] of the child table like ""myparent:parenttype""."

A new key for the ['palettes'][key] section, to be added next to the ""canNotCollapse"" setting:
http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/core-documentation/doc_core_tca/4.6.0/view/1/3/#id2629406

New setting:

------------------------------------------------------------
isHiddenPalette

boolean

If set, then this palette will never be shown, but the fields of the palette are technically rendered as hidden elements in the TCEForm. This is sometimes useful when you want to set a field's value by JavaScript from another user-defined field. You can also use it along with the IRRE (TCA type ""inline"") foreign_selector feature if you don't want the relation field to be displayed (it must be technically present and rendered though, that's why you should put it to a hidden palette in that case).

32997;TCA Reference;Bug;;Closed;Should have;Documentation for [FEATURE] Add possibility to define foreign_match_fields for IRRE inline relations.;Ingmar Schlecht;Francois Suter;23/4/2012 22:18;;4.7.0;5/1/2012;;;100;5/1/2012 15:37;;;416850;;;"This is the documentation for the issue #29296 with change request: https://review.typo3.org/#change,7669

The patch adds basically the same match fields functionality, which was previously already possible for ""select"" and ""group"" fields now also to the field type ""inline"".

In the select fields documentation, it is documented like this:

MM_match_fields
array
Array of field=>value pairs to both insert and match against when writing/reading MM relations


Now, for the ""inline"" field type, it should read like this:

----------------
foreign_match_fields
array
Array of field=>value pairs to both insert and match against when writing/reading IRRE relations. Using the match fields, it is possible to re-use the same child table in more than one field of the parent table by using a match field with different values for each of the use cases.

Example: Imagine you have a parent table called ""company"" and a child table called ""persons"". Now, if you want the company table to have two fields of type ""inline"", one called ""employees"" and one called ""customers"", both containing ""persons"". Then you could use a (hidden) field called ""role"" on the child (person) table to keep them apart. The match TCA configuration of the parent table would then look like this:

<pre>
Example:
$TCA['ty_myext_company'] = array (
	...
	'columns' => array (
		...
		'employees' => array (
			'config' => array (
				'type' => 'inline',
				'foreign_table' => 'ty_myext_person',
				'foreign_field' => 'company',
				'foreign_match_fields' => array(
					'role' => 'employee',
				),
			),
		),
		'customers' => array (
			'config' => array (
				'type' => 'inline',
				'foreign_table' => 'ty_myext_person',
				'foreign_field' => 'company',
				'foreign_match_fields' => array(
					'role' => 'customer',
				),
			),
		),
	),
</pre>

Since the update to MediaWiki 1.18 these tables do not display correctly anymore (see above example): The first row _below_ the actual header is displayed as if it was a header row, too.

Obviously the HTML structure of tables has changed. The example table now uses this nesting of tags:

table - thead - tr - th
      - tbody - tr - td <-- This one looks like a header cell, but should not!
                   - td

I know exactly what you mean. However, we can not be 100% sure that every extension developer follows our policies. Ignoring this fact (and not dealing with it in the Security Guide) would inappropriate, too.

In an ideal world, all developers follow the policies but this is theoretical only and can not be guaranteed. The practical way is to keep extensions up-to-date or (and this is what I explicitly stated in the document):

""...updating extensions whenever a new version was published is a good idea in general - at least the consideration of it.""

_TYPO3 version 4.6.0, Install Tool -> All Configuration -> fileDenyPattern_

Due to the fact that this appears in the Install Tool and at the appropriate spot, I assume this is an official statement and the Security Team backs up this statement, which means, we should either consider to state and explain this in the Security Guide as well or (if this is not a valid recommendation from a Security Team's perspective), we should discuss the removal from the Install Tool.

We will certainly discuss and explain the ""fileDenyPattern"" configuration in the Security Guide, and everyone who will check/adjust this value will also see this statement in the Install Tool, so I think we should not ignore this.

Since TYPO3 4.6 we also have XLIFF files. Their structure should also be explained.

Here is an example file, locallang.xlf:
<code class=""XML"">
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
<xliff version=""1.0"">
	<file source-language=""en"" datatype=""plaintext"" original=""messages"" date=""2011-10-18T18:20:51Z"" product-name=""my-ext"">

		<body>
			<trans-unit id=""headerComment"" xml:space=""preserve"">
				<source>The default Header Comment.</source>
			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id=""generator"" xml:space=""preserve"">
				<source>The ""Generator"" Meta Tag.</source>
			</trans-unit>
		</body>
	</file>
</xliff>
</code>

---

Also explain, how a translated version looks like.
Basically it is the same as the English file with the following changes:
* file name: short version of the name of the language is prepended, e.g. de.locallang.xlf
* content:
** file tag: target-language=""de"" added
** for each source tag: Add a ""target"" sibling
** Put the translation inside the target tag.

Here is a translation of the example from above. It must then be called de.locallang.xlf:
<code class=""XML"">
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
<xliff version=""1.0"">
	<file source-language=""en"" target-language=""de"" datatype=""plaintext"" original=""messages"" date=""2011-10-18T18:20:51Z"" product-name=""my-ext"">
		<header/>
		<body>
			<trans-unit id=""headerComment"" xml:space=""preserve"">
				<source>The default Header Comment.</source>
				<target>Der Standard-Header-Kommentar.</target>
			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id=""generator"" xml:space=""preserve"">
				<source>The ""Generator"" Meta Tag.</source>
				<target>Der ""Generator""-Meta-Tag.</target>
			</trans-unit>
		</body>
	</file>
</xliff>
</code>



Difference to XML files: Only one translation possible per file. For multiple languages, you need multiple files.

Although you might think it is self-evident, better add that after a Security Bulletin updates should also be done really quickly.

If one of these was hacked, the attacker can also access all the others with the same hash.

Solution: 
Use salted hashes. Doing so produces different hashes for the same password.
In TYPO3 the system extension ""saltedpasswords"" can do that.

To use this extension, the password must be transfered in clear text.
To prevent the password being spied on the way through the internet, you should use a secure channel to transfer the password.
To do so, you have 2 possibilities: Make sure that your site is only available via SSL. If you cannot do that, you should use the system extension ""rsaauth"", which basically works like SSL."

But it does not tell, how such an attack can look like and how it can happen. Maybe it would be an idea to add this, as this gives the user a better understanding of how to prevent this.

* Often the attacker manipulates PHP files on the server. E.g. inside a PHP file (which might often be the central index.php) he inserts something like @eval(base64_decode(JGPerLmejDnWIMskWmYmz...))@ which is decoded malicius code.
* The attackers often gain access to these files via FTP. Stealing FTP credentials can happen by trojans, which may be installed, when the user just visits dangerous sites (gambling, untrustworthy offers for cheap software, porn...) and if he does not use the most up to date version of his browser and/or operating system.
* When a FTP account is set up, it is extremely important to specify the directory, which the user should have access to. E.g. if not configured properly, this can easliy default to the root folder of a TYPO3 installation, so that the user cannot only upload files to @fileadmin/@, but so that he can also modify @index.php@ or @typo3conf/localconf.php@.

===
This extensions checks the Web site for malicious code that may have been injected. In the majority of hacking attempts the hacker tries to include foreign code in the site that will be executed whenever the page is requested.

Most of these hacking attempts are done with automated scripts that scan a server for index.php, index.html and index.htm pages and insert additional code into these.

Since in TYPO3 all page requests go through the index.php file in the root directory any additional code in this file will be executed with every page request.

The extension checkmysite is analyzing the content of this index.php and checks for any malicious code. If any suspicious code is found, a set of predefined actions can be taken.

While this extension will not discover every hacking attempt of a website, it will discover dangerous modifications of the index.php file which accounts for 90-95% of all hacking attacks.

As it covers more than 90% of all hacking attemps, it seems to be an easy possiblilty to drastically elevate security. So it might be a good idea to mention, that this tool is available and maybe to link to its page in TER. "

It would be good to do this cleanup before we start migrating the existing manuals to DocBook. 

We realized that we do not have the man power to update them and to keep all these manuals updated. We looked them through and found doc_tut to be rather helpful. The plan is to keep that manual updated in the future. A first version was already re-released as doc_tut_editors. 
However, we will not update all the other old manuals.

But obviously those old manuals should still be kept in an archive somewhere, if only for the documentation team to refer to them, if needed (for example, when one decides to write on a given topic and wants to look at stuff that Kasper may have written on that topic back then).

""I've been exploring the various doc sites, and am wondering about the division of information between them. There seems to be much duplicate information. For example, the wiki often seems to contain information that belongs in the manuals.""

I see the same problem.

We should (re)define, what we want to have the wiki for.
You name *extension manuals*, I can add *official documents* like TSref and TSconfig, where there are copies in the Wiki. 
For some of those documents translations have been created (which is a good thing).
But their problem is, that they are not the most current versions and that noone updates even the English texts. The translations first are based on the old English text and second are often incomplete.
*For the official documents* I propose to write the main authors of the wiki translations and to integrate them into our official forge projects. They should do their translations there (as we do that already for many translations).

*For the other manuals* we won't care for them. Maybe it's an idea to leave them in the Wiki...?

I would say we should not add it to TSref, but leave it inside the extension. First because it would completely blow up the document. Secondly because all other cObjects would kind of disappear behind this giant block.

The wiki should then be updated to that new design. We should then create a new skin. It should be based on the vector skin in the version, which is current for our MediaWiki version. (And not based on the TYPO3Skin, as there were many changes in MediaWiki, which improve e.g. caching (RessourceLoader) and our old skin does not yet take advantage of them.)

The old skin (""typo3design"") can stay. (Or we could just remove it, who needs a secondary skin?)
Then the new skin must be set as default in LocalSettings.php.
And we must change the default setting for the skin to the name of the new skin for all users, who had selected typo3design before. This can be done with the ""maintenance script userOptions.php"":http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Skin_configuration#Set_a_Default_Skin_for_a_Wiki.

An own mwsuggest.js is no longer needed. Remove the file and the reference. We have just overwritten everything, which came with the old file (which still was included all the time). No reference has been removed, which had to be added now.

Take the contents of ""MediaWiki:Typo3design.css"":http://wiki.typo3.org/MediaWiki:Typo3design.css and readjust them for the new skin.

Make sure the files in the folder typo3vector/ are up to date with the MediaWiki release 1.19. E.g. vector.js might still be there in an old version.

Make sure the words ""and you can edit"" are not hardcoded in the header of the page (login). They should use an l10n label.

common_t3/portalnavigation.php is no longer the same in all skins: typo3vector comes with an own one. Move portalnavigation.php away from common_t3/ into the skin folders. Split up portalnavigation.__i18n__.php into two files and change registration in LocalSettings.php.

Make sure that the Piwik Tracking Code (Typo3Design.php, at the end of the HTML structure) also gets part of the new skin.

It is outdated and it is not structured ideally. 
The first thing you see is an advert for an old book. I guess most people do not want to spend 30 ? and wait some days, before they get some information, when they visit the documentation page. 
Then there are many sections, but e.g. as an absolute beginner, several seem more or less right, but none is the one where you really think: *This* is the *one* for me. 
Judging it from todays point of view, this section only contains a small fraction of the available ""sources of knowledge"". But the beginner does not know that and the ""Ressources"" section mainly contains broken links (which really creates no good impression). So he most probably does not know where the different sources are and how they are structured. That way he is more or less helpless after scanning through the few texts on there.

To improve the situation I would like to update the documentation pages. I think that small changes can already make things noticeably better:
On the starting page the advert for that old book should go away. All groups of users should get clear pointers on where to look for what.
We should update the ""Ressources"" section. I would replace the broken links with an overview, which lists all the different ressources we have (e.g. newsgroups, documentation extensions in TER, the same documentation in HTML pages on typo3.org, the wiki...) and what they are useful for.

This is not desired.

OpenOffice does not show headlines there, but normal paragraphs. They also do not appear in the TOC inside OpenOffice. Their headline styling is not activated in OpenOffice and cannot be changed there.

However, .sxw files are just .zip files. Inside the .sxw file there is a file called ""content.xml"", which contains the text of the document including all style commands.

At the places where we get our ""phantom headlines"" in TER, there everytime should be a normal paragraph, but instead there in fact is a headline(!) element with a specified text-level:
<code class=""xml"">
<text:h text:style-name=""P9"" text:level=""2""/>
</code>

I now replaced each of them with an empty paragraph:
<code class=""xml"">
<text:p text:style-name=""Standard""/>
</code>
This is used that way for empty paragraphs at other places, too, and there it does not cause this problem.

Any deep links contain always the version number:

Another point is, that the whole API documentation on TYPO3.org is pretty outdated (Last update 21.03.2010)

Is there an updated version somewhere?

28813;Coding Guidelines;Task;;Resolved;Must have;Add information to never use language labels for configuration options;Chris topher;Chris topher;8/5/2013 2:37;;;7/8/2011;;;100;7/8/2011 17:41;;;212650;;;"In our language files we have some labels which only consist of an ""internal"" string.

EXT:wizard_crpages/cshimages/wizards_1.png, EXT:wizard_crpages/cshimages/wizards_2.png
xEXT_loremipsum
</pre>

These strings are used for internal purposes, e.g. the first one shows a link ""More information in the text of Timer frequency"". The second one includes two images from the folder wizard_sortpages...

The problem is that people obviously don't know the meaning of these internal strings. We see on the Translation Server that they try to translate them as a sentence.

This will break the context sensitive help. You will e.g. get non-existing images and broken ?More information? links.

Configuration like this belongs into TS, not into language labels. It is really bad use of l10n.

We cannot remove the ones which are already there, but we can at least prevent new ones from being added.

So:
Add a note that such strings in language labels are *not allowed*."

The stdWrap property filelink (= function filelink) has a property called @icon_thumbSize@.

*Property:* icon_thumbSize
*Data type:* string /stdWrap

*Description:*
Defines the size of the preview image.
That is the value of the ""&size="" parameter in the scr attribute inside the img tag, which links to ""t3lib/thumbs.php""
""icon"" needs to be set for the option to take effect.
File extension of the image file must be part of ""icon_image_ext_list"".
""iconCObject"" may not be set.

One and two values are possible, see the examples:
Examples:
icon_thumbSize = 150
icon_thumbSize = 40x40
The second produces an image tag like:
EXAMPLE STILL UNTESTED!
<img src=""../../../thumbs.php?&dummy=...&file=login.gif&size=40x40&md5sum=..."">


It is defined in typo3/sysext/cms/tslib/class.tslib_content.php, function filelink().
Here are excerpts of the code:
<pre>
if ($conf['icon']) {
  if ($conf['iconCObject']) {
    ...
  } else {
    $thumbSize = '',
    if ($conf['icon_thumbSize'] || $conf['icon_thumbSize.']) {

Here is an example I tested:
<pre>
  lib.Gifbuild = IMAGE
  lib.Gifbuild.file = GIFBUILDER
  lib.Gifbuild.file {
    offset=10,15
    XY = 500,350

Means that the relation to the records of ""foreign_table"" / ""new_foreign_table"" is done with a M-M relation with a third ""join"" table.
--------

I guess the ""new_foreign_table"" should be ""neg_foreign_table"" instead. As there is no property ""new_foreign_table"" for a type=>select TCA field.

Note that the use of upper case in the old text is also wrong.

In this section of the TSref there is no information about

page_id#CE_uid is mentioned there and #CE_uid as well but not the standalone #.

So it would be necessary to change the current text to the one below, which is slightly modfied due to some other errors within the same paragraph.



Now the input can be an alias or page-id. If the input is an integer it will be treated as a page-id, if there are two comma separated integers, this indicates a pair of  id and type. If there is at least one non numerical character, this will be recognized as an alias.

You can append a ""#"" to page-ids or aliases. Followed by another integer this will indicate a tt_content record on the page to jump to! (if .section-property is present, it overrides this).

If you insert only ""#234"" where ""234"" is a tt_content record number, or insert just a single ""#"" without any integers around it, the link will always point to the current page.

2.8 LOCALISATION -> Overriding LOCAL_LANG values 

<pre>TYPO3 offers an API for overriding LOCAL_LANG values by custom XML files. Provided that the inclusion of the locallang file is handled by the language class then your custom file will be included after the real locallang file(s) and the arrays will be merged together. Let's look at an example:

Example

We want to change the label of the logout button from ""Logout"" to ""End session"". What we do is this:
1. First, find out where in the XML code the label is output so that you know the label key and locallang file. In this case the script ""alt_menu.php"" outputs the button which is generated by a function from the file ""class.alt_menu_functions.inc"". Looking into this file we find that the line ""$LANG->sL('LLL:EXT:lang/locallang_core.xml:buttons.logout')"" fetches the label for the button.

2. Create an alternative XML file with the labelkeys you want to override (in our case ""buttons.logout""). I have created the file ""typo3conf/langoverride_core.xml"" which looks like this:
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8"" standalone=""yes"">
<T3locallang>
    <data type=""array"">
        <languageKey index=""default"" type=""array"">
            <label index=""buttons.logout"">End session</label>
        </languageKey>
        <languageKey index=""dk"" type=""array"">
            <label index=""buttons.logout"">Afslut session</label>
        </languageKey>
    </data>
</T3locallang>

Notice how it contains both an English and Danish label.

3. Configure the script to override values in the file ""EXT:lang/locallang_core.xml"" This is simply done by adding an entry in the $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SYS']['locallangXMLOverride'] array which points to the overriding file:
$TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SYS']['locallangXMLOverride']['EXT:lang/locallang_core.xml']['myLangOverride'] = 'typo3conf/langoverride_core.xml',

The file path of ""typo3conf/langoverride_core.xml"" is relative to the PATH_site constant. You can also keep the file in an extension. In that case you would have to enter the file reference like 'EXT:myext/langoverride_core.xml' - and the file will automatically be found wherever your extension is installed.

The name of the array key 'myLangOverride' is arbitrary, but you are advised to give it a meaningful (and unique) value.

Additionally in the frontend it is also possible to override labels with the Typoscript key ""_LOCAL_LANG"". This takes precedence over locallangXMLOverride labels.
</pre> 

*Change the word ''XLLfile'' in 2.8 LOCALISATION -> Including locallang files in modules to ''locallangXMLOverride''. 
*Add the following paragraph somewhere:
<pre>Note: Using the array $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['BE']['XLLoverride'] is deprecated and should not be done anymore. $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SYS']['locallangXMLOverride'] is more flexible and also works for the frontend.</pre>

  How and When To Deprecate APIs
  Here are some general rules on how to remove existing functions or parameters from TYPO3. Generally, functions or parameters are removed two major versions after they were set to be deprecated.
  
  If you want to remove a parameter of a TYPO3 core function, please note it within the phpDoc param part:
  
  /**
   * ...
   * @param	string	DEPRECATED since TYPO3 4.X - is not used anymore because...
   * ... 
   */
  
  For removing a whole function in one of the TYPO3 core classes, you can use the phpDoc @deprecated parameter. Use it like this:
  
  /**
   * ...
   * @return...
   * @deprecated since TYPO3 4.X - is not used anymore, use FUNCNAME instead 
   */
  
  The release-manager of version TYPO3 4.X+2 will remove deprecated parameters or functions then.

Cover page:
- Year 2010 --> 2011.
- Fix version number to be 4.5.0 (cover page), leave em_conf for upload to TER.

Introduction:
- Add lines on 4.5:
@
For TYPO3 4.5 some checkboxes at the bottom of modules were made hidable. This applies to the options at the bottom of the list and the filelist module as well as to the checkbox ""Show secondary options"". Some settings concerning TCEforms were added. FlexForms are editable via TSconfig and group access lists now. TYPO3 4.5 comes with a new taskcenter - the according documentation was added. Another important change is that beginning with TYPO3 4.5 the word ""shortcut"" is only used for a shortcut to another page and no longer where ""bookmark"" was meant. Therefore the according options were renamed. So for example ""enableShortcuts"" is now called ""enableBookmarks"" and so on. 
@
- Remove note on new template
- Change link to the wiki page with the changes. It should be called something with 4.4 and 4.5

Content:
- Somewhere it says ""Testsite"" Package. Not sure if that really means this really old thing. However, use Introduction Package instead.
- In the description of [tablename].[field].[dataStructKey].[flexSheet]:
?Configuration for the data structure of a _field_ with type ""flex"".?
should be
?TCEFORM.[tablename].[field].[dataStructKey].[flexSheet] configures a whole FlexForm sheet.?
- Add/change the properties as needed. ""See the Pending Documentation page"":http://wiki.typo3.org/Pending_Documentation.
Test each of them, if
-- it works as described
-- the description is clear.

Form:
- Adjust width of columns (leave table width unchanged) where needed.
- Check that linebreaks are at right place (fix pagination).
- Fix table of contents."

Debug output

During development it is allowed to use debug() or t3lib_div::debug() function
calls to produce debug output. However all debug statements must be removed
(removed, not commented!) before committing the code to the Subversion repository.
</pre>

I wrote a sniff which looks for debug functions like debug(), t3lib_div::debug(), print_r(), var_dump() and xdebug(). It found also such function even if they are commented out.

But there are several places in the core where this functions were used. Its no questions that debug() should be allowed in class.t3lib_utility_debug.php or t3lib_div::debug(), but whats about with places like

allow also

Thus; I propose a much more automatic approach. I have written a PHP script that traverses the icons and outputs a nicely formatted HTML file. In a second step; this file is transformed to a PDF; via the ""wkhtmltopdf"" utility.

There is a new possibility to access the most important TYPO3 resources. Martin Holtz of the docTeam has programmed an openSearch for TYPO3. For those of you who don't know OpenSearch: These are the browsers searches that you find in firefox and IE in the upper right corner. 

With the TYPO3 search you can search through wiki.typo3.org, the whole extension list on typo3.org, through forge.typo3.org, in TSref, in the API and in the (german) forum at Mittwald Medien. 

A little example of how to use the search:
You just enter ""keyword searchword"" into the input field. Depending on the keyword you change where to look for your searchword. Entering ""ext tt_news"" gets you to the result page you also come to when you search on typo3.org -> Extensions. For an API search it would be e.g. ""api typolink"". If you have multiple words to search for it would be like ""ext news feed"", so the first word is always taken as keyword and all words after that as what you actually want to search. When not using a keyword the search defaults to wiki search.

The search even has a nice auto-completion feature for expressions out of the TSref. So if you are not quite sure how an option is spelled you can use that feature to show you. All in all a very nice tool for finding answers to TYPO3 questions. 

Please note that the whole search tool is in expiremental state, therefore any feedback is appreciated. If you happen to have any questions, positive or negative feedback or anything else you just wish to say do it at the corresponding wiki[1] page. There you can also learn how to install and use the search. 

ABOUT THE DOCTEAM:
The DocTEAM keeps the documentation effort focussed the right way to support documentation-writers. Want to help? Just join us! [2]

Es gibt eine neue Mˆglichkeit auf die wichtigsten TYPO3-Ressourcen schnell und einfach zuzugreifen. Martin Holtz vom DocTeam hat f¸r TYPO3 eine eigene OpenSearch geschrieben. F¸r alle die jetzt denken ""h‰? OpenSearch???"": OpenSearch, das sind die Browsersuchen, also die Suchen, die im Firefox und im Internet Explorer ¸ber das Suchfeld rechts oben erreichbar sind.

‹ber die TYPO3-Suche kˆnnen das TYPO3-Wiki, die Extension-Liste, forge.typo3.org, die TSref, die TYPO3-API und das Forum von Mittwald Medien durchsucht werden.

Ein kleines Beispiel:
Bei Eingabe von ""ext tt_news"" kommt man auf die gleiche Seite, als h‰tte man unter www.typo3.org auf Extensions geklickt und dann dort ""tt_news"" in das Suchfeld eingegeben. F¸r eine Suche in der API tippt man z.B. ""api typolink"". Weitere Suchwˆrter kˆnnen einfach angehangen werden, zum Beispiel ""ext news feed"". Wird kein Keyword angegeben, sucht man automatisch im Wiki, ist der Suchbegriff in der TSref vorhanden, wird man dorthin weitergeleitet. 

F¸r Suchbegriffe aus der TSref gibt es sogar automatische Vorschl‰ge, d.h. wenn man sich bei der Schreibweise oder dem genauen Namen nicht ganz sicher ist, hilft die Suche auch dabei. Alles in allem ein nettes Tool, um Suchen und Finden rund um TYPO3 zu beschleunigen.

Bitte beachten: Die Suche ist zur Zeit noch im experimentellen Status. Bei Fragen, Anregungen, Lob und Kritik einfach im Wiki[1] melden, dort gibt es auch die Suche inklusive Anleitung.

DAS DOCTEAM:
Das DocTeam koordiniert die Dokumentationsarbeit und versucht so, f¸r eine bessere, verst‰ndlichere und vollst‰ndigere Dokumentation zu sorgen. Ihr mˆchtet helfen? Dann macht einfach mit! [2]

Is the following text good so?

------------
subject: doc_template 1.1.1 -- reloaded

Hello extension-authors,

we, the DocTeam, have made a major update to the template of TYPO3-documentation-manuals.

http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/doc_template/1.1.1/

http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/core-documentation/doc_template/


##Please use this new version - just copy the content of your manuals into the new version and you get the new features.

* fixed typo (thanks to Georg Ringer)
* added TYPO3-logo, chapter-number and chapter-title to the header, for better orientation
* TYPO3-coloring scheme
* added hyperlinking to the TOC (yeah!)
* added PDF as example for the TOC-linking
* Font Tahoma (if you don't use it a good alternative font will be used)

If you have any change requests put it in http://bugs.typo3.org bugtracker / documentation with title prefix ""doc_template"".

We will use this layout for the core-documents, too, but updating will take some days ... or weeks.

Cheers!
DocTeam

868;Documentation;Task;;Closed;Won't have this time;FLOW3 as a  TYPO3 v4 Extension;Daniel Br¸ﬂler;Daniel Br¸ﬂler;20/10/2010 11:40;;sprint 2008/05;25/6/2008;;0.00;100;25/6/2008 15:25;;;4450;;;"this as bridge to the extension-coordination-team
from Jochen Rau in 5-mailing-list:

as I started to integrate the Package Manager of FLOW3 in 'EXT:gimmefive' (see http://forge.typo3.org/projects/show/extension-gimmefive) I realized that I'm on my way to backport almost the whole source code of FLOW3. That makes no sense. So I changed the strategy and altered gimmefive to be a bridge to the original source code of FLOW3. There are only a few things left to be done:

1) The class t3lib_cs in PHP6/Resources/PHP/class.t3lib_cs.php should be renamed (Issue #651).
2) There should be a convenient way to download stable snapshots of the packages FLOW3 and PHP6 as extensions for TYPO3 V4. What do you suggest?
3) Caching and Ressource Management is disabled until now but should be enabled. Do you expect any conflicts with TYPO3 V4?
4) The AOP Framework is not available until now. Should it be enabled for V4?

Comment on 2): Until now I checkout FLOW3 to the root of my web-server and make symbolic links to FLOW3 and PHP6 in typo3conf/ext/.

Comment on 2): I have to clarify the things a little bit. FLOW3 (and thus 'gimmefive') requires at least PHP v5.2. You don't have to switch to PHP v6.0. The 'PHP6' named in the manual of 'gimmefive' is only a package of TYPO5 that provides some wrapper classes to get UTF8 strings treated right."
