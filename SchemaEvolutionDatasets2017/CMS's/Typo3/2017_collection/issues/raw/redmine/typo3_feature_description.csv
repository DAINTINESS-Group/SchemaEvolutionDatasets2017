... tables should have the possibility getting two icons assigned.
While it's in general possible to override any icons with hooks like overrideIconOverlay it's much work and I never found any description about that, so I still have to fiddle that out, especially concerning ajax-calls from inside of inherited BE-forms.

An option to assign two different icons where each one is used depending on the perspective, the logic of IRRE would be much more comfortable.

I know it's getting deeper than just skinning, so I don't mind if the issue is sorted somewhere else."

  20.wrap = This|solution
  20.stdWrap.wrap = &nbsp,|&nbsp,
}
</code></pre>
This results in ""@This is a working solution.@""

The purpose of this property is to allow the integrator to add multiply stdWrap statements without having to remember the rather complex sorting order in which the stdWrap functions are executed.

orderedStdWrap consists of an array of keys (like COA). Each key carries the value of content and then a normal stdWrap is done. So one could think each key as a TEXT object with the value of the current content.

The execution is done in order which means that all keys are first sorted and then process separately.
In this example 10.innerWrap is executed first, followed by 10.wrap.
Then the next key is processed which is 20. Afterwards the 30.wrap is executed on what is already created.

orderedStdWrap returns the content after processing it with each given key.

E.g. t3lib_div::getUserObj produces the debug output
debug(""Class '"" . $class . ""' was not prepended with '"" . $checkPrefix . ""'"", 't3lib_div::getUserObj'),

The developer will add more debug commands when the PHP code is under development.
At the end a tool should help to remove all debug commands. However there are debug commands which should remain and never be removed.

So I need a hint at the end of the debug command.

E.g.

debug(""Class '"" . $class . ""' was not prepended with '"" . $checkPrefix . ""'"", 't3lib_div::getUserObj'), // must remain

or

debug(""Class '"" . $class . ""' was not prepended with '"" . $checkPrefix . ""'"", 't3lib_div::getUserObj'), // %keep

Then a tool could search and remove all debug commands in the PHP code except the line which have the '%keep' at the end.

or use this convention

debug(""* Class '"" . $class . ""' was not prepended with '"" . $checkPrefix . ""'"", 't3lib_div::getUserObj'),
A leading '*' in the debug output means that this is an error debugging."

The commit message already gives a good explaination:

Problem:
* Cacheable content is always page specific.
Pages cannot share cached content.
* Cacheable content has no individual lifetime
but is bound to the lifetime of the page where it is placed.

Solution:
Introduce new configuration options that will store the
content into the caching framework:

Examples:
5 = TEXT
5 {
cache.key = mycurrenttimestamp
cache.tags = tag_a,tag_b,tag_c
cache.lifetime = 3600
data = date : U
strftime = %H:%M:%S
}

or (for page specific cache that doesn't take
other parameters into account)
5 = TEXT
5 {
cache.key = mycurrenttimestamp_{page:id}
cache.key.insertData = 1
}

Currently for extensions there can only be one segment for the vendor name.

The rule is \<VendorName>\<ExtensionKey>\<Folder1>\<Folder2>\<ClassName>

While the extension key must be transformed from underscores to upper camel case and the folders must reside in a ""Classes"" folder on the top level inside the extension folder and lastly the class file must be named exatly like the class (case sensitive!) with a trailing "".php""

For core classes we built in exceptions in many places; so that we coud use ""TYPO3"" as the vendor and ""CMS"" as the product name; before the segment with the extension key starts. This has been done to not have conflicting namespaces e.g. for Fluid if we would have skipped the product name ""CMS""

Seems like the new feature about adding new TCA elements isn't well documented; currently.

Changes to 6.2 are:
* Having slots preconfigured in ext_tables isn't required any longer; it's just enough to have proper files placed in Configuration/TCA/{tablename}.php
* They kind of take the place of dynamicConfigFile
* Format is ""return the tca array part of that particular table"" instead of ""just overwrite/merge the $GLOBAL['TCA'] array"".

Maybe this documentation section should clearly point out that it's *only for new TCA objects*. When extending existing tables; like pages; you sill need to have ext_tables.php lines and use the _\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::addFieldsToPalette_ call.

The current documentation sticks to the old fashioned way of always adding tca types to the ext_tables.php.

* Document Root needs to be writable
* One path above document root (""../"") needs to be writable (new directories allowed to be created)
* ""tar"" command available for extracting the core package

h3. Disabling the Core Updater

To disable the Core Updater functionality altogether (in order to avoid users using it in the Install Tool; i.e. if you have your own update mechanism); you can set this environment variable:

 TYPO3_DISABLE_CORE_UPDATER=1

Since TYPO3 CMS 6.2 it is possible to select records from the root-page level; like from the table ""sys_category"". For this case; it is required that ""root"" is set.
Besides that; version records can be selected directly by setting the value to ""-1""; this allows to directly select workspace versioned records.

Category Registry changes will also be applied after Configuration/TCA/Overrides/ has been processed

You write:

Funny...but in your example there is no solution how to hide/deactivate cols in BE-Layouts.

There is only a hint in sourcecode:

// Draw the pre-generated header with edit and new buttons if a colPos is assigned.

58698;ReST tools;Feature;;New;Should have;develop pygments TypoScript syntax-highlighter plugin + develop pygments Fluid-Templating syntax-highlighter plugin;Stephan Jorek;;17/8/2015 7:57;;;11/5/2014;;;0;11/5/2014 15:12;;;1678550;;;"h1. The Proposal - Part I:

As a first step the current ""TypoScript syntax-highlighter"":http://forge.typo3.org/projects/tools-rest/repository/revisions/master/entry/ExtendingPygmentsForTYPO3/ should be installable via pip; setup tools or the like.

This would allow external projects to integrate TypoScript syntax-highlighting much easier; simply by issuing a command like:
<pre>
$ easy_install Pygments-Typo3-Lexers
</pre>

The project I'm actively using; which would benefit from this solution: http://nevir.github.io/groc/ 

h1. The Proposal  - Part II:

Later on this separate plugin could get merged directly into _pygments_. Then external _pygments_-related projects and users are able to render syntax-highlighted TypoScript out-of-the-box. The main user of _pygments_ I know for sure is: ""Github"":https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages#defaults ? They are using (at least) _pygments_ to provide syntax-highlighting. A initial hint I stumbled upon is ""published here"":http://www.pocoo.org/#users . I followed this path and had in another project I'm contributing to; the chance to talk to some github-staff; who confirmed my assumption (verbally). They said; that they update their _pygments_ quite frequently; often daily or whenever a new syntax-lexer has been added. Therefore it should not be too difficult to get _TypoScript_- and maybe also _Fluid_-syntax-highlighting support into their platform; as long as we implement it properly and convince ""Georg Brandl"":https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld to merge it into his _pygments_. He (and most other folks from this project) seem to be very kind and will certainly helps us to get this done right. But we should not start empty - and of course we don't need to. I think we need to offer something installable or at least merge-able in order to get them to work with us.

h1. Suggested Solution:

In order to achieve this goal it is necessary to stick to python's and especially _pygments_' development process. Therefore I created ""a new mercurial-based project on bitbucket"":https://bitbucket.org/sjorek/pygments-typo3-lexers that currently contains everything I found and is (if not already; then very soon) installable as suggested in Part I from above. I opened up this project to invite everybody interested to join the discussion and development-process there. I promise to manage this project open; transparent and as often as I can. But I don't want to ?over-pace? the whole process. I'm convinced that I'm a experienced enough Python-; _pygments_ and TYPO3/Flow developer to guide this process - at least I hope so for now. :-)

h1. Open Questions:

# Did I violate any licences by creating the project on bitbucket and distributing the current TypoScript-syntax-highlighter as a installable _pygments_-plugin ?
# Does the project on bitbucket violate any specifications or guidelines ?
# Who developed the current ""TypoScript-syntax-highlighter"":http://forge.typo3.org/projects/tools-rest/repository/revisions/master/entry/ExtendingPygmentsForTYPO3/_incoming/typoscript.py and how can I get in touch with them ? (Who is behind _?Donation Based Hosting?_ ?)
# Shall we provide a combined _pygments_-plugin for TypoScript and Fluid or two separate _pygments_-plugins ?
# The current TypoScript-syntax-highlighter seems to be incomplete; right ?
  - The lastest addition to paths is missing; ie.: @TCEFORMS.table.field.""flex-form.sub-path"".?@

h1. Open Tasks:

# Write a simple roadmap
# Invite everybody interested and able to use mercurial to the bitbucket project.



As always I appreciate any feedback I can get here. Please do *not* use the bitbucket issue tracker to discuss this proposal yet. Use bitbucket only it for real code-issues only or better ignore it until we officially decide to use it.

allow also

""string""  - adhoc datatype obvious from the content of the quoted string
	Example: 	""x;y;z""

'[list of]' + datatype	- a comma list of values for the data type; normally with no space between.
	Example: 	[list of] int

[datatype] '(.....)' - additional information to the data type; like a range for values.
	Example: 	int (1-100)

For anyone; who will search for same topic; I've made a research by simple search of '$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register' ($TSFE->register gave 0 results) in content of all PHP files in TYPO3 4.4. Here is a list with some my explanations:

class.tx_cssstyled_content_pi1.php

function render_uploads($content;$conf) - Rendering the ""Filelinks"" type content element; called from TypoScript (tt_content.uploads.20):
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['ICON_REL_PATH'] - keeps relative path to file + filename
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['filename'] - self-explainable
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['path'] - self-explainable
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['fileSize'] - self-explainable
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['fileExtension'] - self-explainable
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['description'] - description for current file from 'imagecaption' field
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['linkedIcon'] - not sure about that; but I think is is bool value; defining; should file icon be linked or not
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['linkedLabel'] - same as above; but for label

function render_textpic($content; $conf) - Rendering the IMGTEXT content element; called from TypoScript (tt_content.textpic.20)
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['imageCount'] - count of all image in block
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['renderGlobalCaption'] - bool value; which defines; shoul a global caption be rendered below image block
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['IMAGE_NUM'] - number of current image in set (DEPRECATED)
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['IMAGE_NUM_CURRENT'] - number of current image in set (not deprecated :))
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['ORIG_FILENAME'] - path to the image + image name
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['imagewidth'] - self-explainable
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['imagespace'] - self-explainable
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['imageheight'] - self-explainable
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['rowwidth'] - width of whole block of images
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['rowWidthPlusTextMargin'] - same; as above + margin to the text
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['columnwidth'] - maximum possible width of image block + spaces at left and right side of block
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['totalwidth'] - not sure; but I guess it is same as $GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['rowwidth']


class.tslib_content.php

function IMGTEXT($conf)
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['IMAGE_NUM']
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['IMAGE_NUM_CURRENT']

function HMENU($conf)
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['count_HMENU'] - current number of a generated HMENU on a website
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['count_HMENU_MENUOBJ'] - number of current menu item for current HMENU object

function SEARCHRESULT($conf)
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['SWORD_PARAMS'] - search words

function TEMPLATE($conf)
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['SUBPART_'.$theKey] - contains html code of subpart; defined by $theKey

public function SWFOBJECT($conf)
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['MMSWFID'] - not sure; what it used for; but it holds: uniqid('mmswf');

public function QTOBJECT($conf)
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['MMQTID'] - uniqid('mmqt');

function lastChanged($tstamp) - Sets the SYS_LASTCHANGED timestamp
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['SYS_LASTCHANGED'] - timestamp of page (or content on current page) last modification

function splitObj($value; $conf) - Implements the ""split"" property of stdWrap; Splits a string based on a token (given in TypoScript properties); sets the ""current"" value to each part and then renders a content object pointer to by a number.
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['SPLIT_COUNT'] - current number of item in split


class.tslib_menu.php
function makeMenu() - Creates the menu in the internal variables; ready for output.
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['count_menuItems'] - number of all items in current menu

function subMenu($uid; $objSuffix='') - Creates a submenu level to the current level - if configured for.
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['count_menuItems'] - as I understood this register holds number of items not for the whole menu; but for current menu level

function writeMenu() - Traverses the result array of menu items configuration (made by generate()) and renders each item.
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['count_HMENU_MENUOBJ'] - number of current menu item for current HMENU object
$GLOBALS['TSFE']->register['count_MENUOBJ'] - number of current menu item for ALL HMENU objects on a page

Hope; that can help for someone after me :)
