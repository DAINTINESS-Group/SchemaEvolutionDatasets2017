# CoEvolutionCumulativeStats
## A simple tool to produce cumulative stats for src-schema co-evolution

This project takes as input the results of the ChartExporter, and specifically the cumulative folder
and produces: 

- A detailed file with the cumulative progress and lags between schema, src code, and, time
- A console output with a single line per input schema history
- A powerpoint file with the profile of the schema histories
