INPUT data
-------------------
The input data are placed in the folder:
    resources/incoming/13_CumulativeProgress_Src-n-Schema 
which is a copy of the data available at
  https://github.com/DAINTINESS-Group/Schema_Evolution_Datasets/blob/master/SchemaEvolutionDatasets2020/2023_EDBT_Source-Schema_CoEvolution/01_data/13_Output_CumulativeProgress_Src-n-Schema.zip

Also available in the folder
  01_src_n_inputData
of this repeatability-oriented submission material


MANUAL Classification
--------------------------------------
The data when first through a manual classification, s.t., they are meaningful indeed.
We don't know/expect that this is also part of the repeatability test of our submission.
Anyway, the material is found in the folder
  00_inputForVisualInspection
of this repeatability-oriented submission material


Installation
-----------------
Src code is found in the  folder
  01_src_n_inputData
of this repeatability-oriented submission material.
We use Eclipse with Java 1.8 and it suffices

Post-processing. 
- Microsoft Excel.
- Orange Data Mining 3.35.0 (  https://orangedatamining.com/ )

Execution & production of xls files
-----------------------------------------------
0. Import the .zip file as project into Eclipse

1. run the main class:
   highlights.CheckForHighLightsApp

2. copy the result printed in the console into a new .tsv file  or a new xls sheet.
Here, also available as  OutputOfSrcExecution.xlsx  in folder:   01_src_n_inputData\ 
This has resulted in the very first sheet '20211223_rawOutputFromEclipse' of
   02_workingXlsFiles/040_TimingEvoPatterns.xlsx
which is the main working spreadsheet

3. (manually) 
With  the aforementioned 02_workingXlsFiles/040_TimingEvoPatterns.xlsx:
Take the aforementioned 20211223_rawOutputFromEclipse sheet and join its contents with the contents of:
https://github.com/DAINTINESS-Group/Schema_Evolution_Datasets/blob/master/SchemaEvolutionDatasets2020/2021_ICDE_AnalysisForTaxa_results/20210608_GlobalSchemaLevelInfo_Reference.xlsx
on the condition filename = projectname (both of which are unique and represent the same project).
This results in the sheet 'SchemaLevelInfo_FULL_CLEAN' of 040_TimingEvoPatterns.xlsx


Production of results
--------------------------
The rest of the work includes working with 040_TimingEvoPatterns.xlsx, each time producing new sheets
0. manual inspection to derive the time patterns and make sure they are meaningful.
1. derivation of "bucketing" limits as discussed in the xls
2. identification of statistical properties by working with Orange and Excel 
Specifically:
2.1 Excel: The results are in the folder 02_workingXlsFiles with:
  - 040_TimingEvoPatterns.xlsx holding limits and the core data set
  - 041_PivotsAndCharts.xlsx as the name implies
2.2. Orange: The folder 03_Working with Orange, contains (a) the .ows setup for the ML tests we used for the paper's results, and, (b) a local copy of the 040_TimingEvoPatterns.xlsx, feeding the data to the Orange ML tasks
