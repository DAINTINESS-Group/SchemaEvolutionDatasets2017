An 'autocreateaccount' right is added to allow  auto-creation when 'createaccount' is not granted to all users.  => Check, if this means that new users do not have to be added anymore in index_sso.php     Maybe they still have to, see createAndPromote.php, which adds them itself.  => Manually adding them is still needed.* AuthManager is concerned with logging in by supplying credentials  to Special:UserLogin or the like, and with creating accounts with  new credentials.

Searchbox overwrite JavaScript?  => Is working.  => Open a few pages and check the console for JS errors!  => Result: No errors.* Skins and extensions can now use FlexBox mixins (.flex-display(@display: flex)  and .flex(@grow: 1, @shrink: 1, @width: auto, @order: 1)) in Less to create  cross-browser-compatible FlexBox rules. Users will still need to add fallback  float rules or the like for compatibility with IE9- separately.* User::getSkin() was removed  => function getSkin is used in several places, but not the function from inside the User class. Is ok.* Skin update ready?!  => Compare with live system and check, if everything still looks the same.  => Is ok.=> Use Firebug to check for JavaScript errors and other problems (e.g. missing mediawiki.util)!* Inside the TOC, there is a new space between classes tocnumber and toctext, which is not underlined.

Use mw.message( ... ).parse() instead.  but there is no backtrace...  => Source might be a page on the wiki, e.g. MediaWiki:Common.js and friends,     something in the skin or something in an extension.  => Might be helpful: Firebug, Script tab, open side panel at the right hand side, see the variables...  => Search a DB dump for hits of these functions then.

'?foo=bar',  $output .= '<a href=''' . htmlspecialchars($link) . '>something</a>',Even if the same link might be used two or three times, it might still be a good idea to encoding it where the final HTML-code is put together and NOT do it one (''for performance-reasons'') some lines above.

This means thatSpecial:RecentChanges and Special:Watchlist show all the changes to eachpage in a given day, sorted by page rather than chronologically.

I have started several discussions around this, because my impression is, that this license is not adequate anymore today (so much has changed in the last few years) and a more modern, contemporary and more established and well-known license should be considered for official TYPO3 docs.Unfortunately, I am not a lawyer and I can't assess the pros and cons and impacts. Additionally, it looks like nobody is really interested in following up on this or can provide good advices.Nevertheless, I dare to ask the question again: should we simply correct the links and stick with the Open Content License or should be consider choosing a new license?'"

While this is often an unwanted scenario, it still may happen for ''microsites'' instances - lots of sites with small page trees. The clearCacheCmd('all') fired by the TypoScript module is then disadvantegous, since it kills way too many cache entries where only entries of the page with the TS record and all its children should be cleared.The solution to just disable the page clear however is not sufficient, since caches of subpages are not cleared, so the proposed solution is only useful if pages with a changed TS record have no sub pages.More general approach: Tag a fe cache entry with its rootline. So if a cache entry belongs to page 42 which is a child of page 23 and that is a child of page 5, then page 42 cache entry would be tagged with ''isChildOf_23'' and ''isChildOf_5'' (or similar). The change the TS module to not fire clearCacheCmd('all'), but clearCacheCmd('cacheTag:isChildOf_5') if TS record of page 5 is changed. clearCacheCmd can do that already. Cache entry for page 23 and 42 would be cleared then. Also flush by tag ''PageId_5''. If done, exactly the correct cache entries would be killed and nothing more.It may only happen that if you ''flushByTag'' a page that alredy has lots of sub pages takes quite some time, so in this case it may be quicker to just ''flush whole cache'' - this does a truncate on Typo3DbBackend cache and an rm -r on file caches and is much quicker than a lengthy ''delete nearly everything''. So, we'd probably need PageTS that controls the flush behaviour (with default to flushByTag).Tagging caches in the frontend with its ''rootline'' could be beneficial for other things as well, maybe for the list/page module for example: Eg. storing a record on a storage page X then triggers a ''clear caches of page Y and Z and all their sub pages, which is currently also not possible.Todo:Find out if the above solution is sane and do-able.Add functionality to add ''rootline'' tags to cache_pages in the frontend.Find out usage of pagesection and see if this one can be tagged as well or if the cache entries are re-used on different pages again - which may torpedo the above idea.Find a sane pageTS syntax to feed clearCacheCmd with options like 'kill everthing below ''me''' and implement it.I'm not 100% sure if the above will survive all checks, but it sounds like a good idea to me. Better tagging in the frontend is long overdue anyway and it may help us at other places as well. I've raised some attention towards this issue to some active contributors already (eg. Markus Klein and Helmut Hummel), we think that this issue could probably be solved this way, but at the moment no one is really digging deep into that and actually working on it - this is one reason why an answer took longer, I'm really sorry for that.Alexander, what do you think, is this a good idea and are you feeling you could dive into this overall topic and search for progress here? I would happily help with providing more information, ideas and technical insights that I have on my radar - eg. I know the caching framework pretty well, but I don't know the FE details on my own without digging myself.I know that the proposed solution is much more complex than just disabling the clear cache action, but I really think this would go into the right direction. My gut feeling is this would be do-able and won't end in ''complexity hell'', cache_pages should be fine, my only doubts are regarding sub cache layers like pagesection, those should get an eye first.'"

This makes higher resolution images appear too small.According to http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Comp/comp.text.tex/2008-05/msg00624.html it should be possible to read the actual image resolution during rendering and change the resize factor dynamically instead of hardcoding it to 50%.I would recommend to include images whose resolution is > 72 dpi at a 1:1 ratio without any dynamic computation. This would let the user choose the actual resolution (think of 300 dpi images for instance).**Note 1:** see instructions ''here'':http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2010/02/the-myth-of-dpi/ on how changing the resolution in Photoshop without altering the pixel size.**Note 2:** Although the previous article states that PNG do not hold dpi, this problem has been found with a PNG, maybe the info is only true if the image was saved for the web in Photoshop.'"

Even only using ''h'' still does not always place the image directly where it belongs. This can also not be fixed by using ''!h'' like so: @\begin{figure}[!h]@. ''!h'' strongly suggests LaTeX to really put the image where it has been found. However, should it for some reason not fit at that exact place, LaTeX will float following text above the image, which again displaces it. Using @\begin{figure}[H]@ finally _does_ position images correctly. In my tests this was the _only_ way to get images placed properly (tested with the CoreAPIReference). This value can be set in conf.py in the latex_elements section:<pre>'figure_align': 'H'</pre>''Docs'':http://sphinx.readthedocs.org/en/latest/config.html#options-for-latex-outputIn order for this option (''H'') to work, we need to use the package ''float'' in the tex file like so:<pre>\usepackage{float}</pre>However, our version of sphinx (version 1.2pre) does not yet support the ''figure_align'' option.

This has an impact in particular for FE plugins. To continue displaying<br> the CSH for their FlexForm, the CSH file must be declared as for other elements, i.e. <pre> t3lib_extMgm::addLLrefForTCAdescr('somekey', 'EXT:myext/locallang_csh.xml'),</pre> The key is defined as follows: <pre>[table name].[field name].[DS pointer field 1](.[DS pointer field 2])</pre> The table and the field are those where the FlexForm is used. In most cases this will be ''tt_content.pi_flexform''. The next elements of the key (still separated with dots) are the values of the field or fields (there may be only one) defined in the ''ds_pointerField'' property for the TCA of the FlexForm field. In the case of plugin options, the ''ds_pointerField'' property is set to ''list_type,CType'', so the key would be of the form:<br> <pre>tt_content.pi_flexform.[value of list_type field].list</pre> ''list'' being the value of the CType field for a FE plugin. To give a complete example, let's assume that the plugin used is from the ''comments'' extension, the full key will be:<br> <pre>tt_content.pi_flexform.comments_pi1.list</pre> because ''comments_pi1'' is the value found in the field ''list_type'' when using the plugin provided by the ''comments'' extension. So the ''comments'' extension would use the following call to register its FlexForm CSH:<br> <pre>t3lib_extMgm::addLLrefForTCAdescr('tt_content.pi_flexform.comments_pi1.list', 'EXT:comments/pi1/locallang_csh.xml'),</pre> With this new method, it is not necessary anymore to point to the CSH&nbsp,file from within the FlexForm's DS, though the ''cshFile'' tag should be left for compatibility with older versions of TYPO3. On top of the above, it is advised (but not required) to use the ''alttitle'' in the CSH structure intensively, as it will improve the information displayed in the help pop-up window. In particular, don't forget to define the ''general alttitle'' which is used at the top of the window. Example: <pre>&lt,label index=''.alttitle''&gt,My plugin's cool configuration options&lt,/label&gt,</pre>'"

The Proposal  - Part II:Later on this separate plugin could get merged directly into _pygments_. Then external _pygments_-related projects and users are able to render syntax-highlighted TypoScript out-of-the-box. The main user of _pygments_ I know for sure is: ''Github'':https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages#defaults ? They are using (at least) _pygments_ to provide syntax-highlighting. A initial hint I stumbled upon is ''published here'':http://www.pocoo.org/#users . I followed this path and had in another project I'm contributing to; the chance to talk to some github-staff; who confirmed my assumption (verbally). They said; that they update their _pygments_ quite frequently; often daily or whenever a new syntax-lexer has been added. Therefore it should not be too difficult to get _TypoScript_- and maybe also _Fluid_-syntax-highlighting support into their platform; as long as we implement it properly and convince ''Georg Brandl'':https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld to merge it into his _pygments_. He (and most other folks from this project) seem to be very kind and will certainly helps us to get this done right. But we should not start empty - and of course we don't need to. I think we need to offer something installable or at least merge-able in order to get them to work with us.h1. Suggested Solution:In order to achieve this goal it is necessary to stick to python's and especially _pygments_' development process. Therefore I created ''a new mercurial-based project on bitbucket'':https://bitbucket.org/sjorek/pygments-typo3-lexers that currently contains everything I found and is (if not already; then very soon) installable as suggested in Part I from above. I opened up this project to invite everybody interested to join the discussion and development-process there. I promise to manage this project open; transparent and as often as I can. But I don't want to ?over-pace? the whole process. I'm convinced that I'm a experienced enough Python-; _pygments_ and TYPO3/Flow developer to guide this process - at least I hope so for now. :-)h1. Open Questions:# Did I violate any licences by creating the project on bitbucket and distributing the current TypoScript-syntax-highlighter as a installable _pygments_-plugin ?# Does the project on bitbucket violate any specifications or guidelines ?# Who developed the current ''TypoScript-syntax-highlighter'':http://forge.typo3.org/projects/tools-rest/repository/revisions/master/entry/ExtendingPygmentsForTYPO3/_incoming/typoscript.py and how can I get in touch with them ? (Who is behind _?Donation Based Hosting?_ ?)# Shall we provide a combined _pygments_-plugin for TypoScript and Fluid or two separate _pygments_-plugins ?# The current TypoScript-syntax-highlighter seems to be incomplete; right ?  - The lastest addition to paths is missing; ie.: @TCEFORMS.table.field.''flex-form.sub-path''.?@h1. Open Tasks:# Write a simple roadmap# Invite everybody interested and able to use mercurial to the bitbucket project.As always I appreciate any feedback I can get here. Please do *not* use the bitbucket issue tracker to discuss this proposal yet. Use bitbucket only it for real code-issues only or better ignore it until we officially decide to use it.Cheerio + Thx;Stephan JorekP.S.: Apologies for my weak english ? if anybody wants to talk to me in my native language - its german ?PPS.: Um pr‰zise zu sein - ick bin Berliner; also immer her mit der Kritik; den Nachfragen und all dem Gepl‰nkel; ick kann det vertragen :-)'"

The fix for this part of the problem must be applied for the very first entries up to 20090729151633.The fields that need checking (old fields up to date x):* edit comments* image descriptions and so on....----h2. Solution approachA German umlaut ''¸'' is displayed as ''√º'' ''example'':http://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/index.php?limit=50&tagfilter=&title=Special%3AContributions&contribs=user&target=80.219.6.224&namespace=&year=2014&month=-1. This problem happens when UTF-8-encoded data is displayed as latin1. However, we _do display_ that data as _UTF-8_, so it must miss one conversion to latin1.Our content is in columns with binary encoding. This means MySQL functions, which convert encodings won't change anything with it, as - for MySQL - it currently _does not have_ any encoding. Something like the following double-convert can be used to convert them anyway:<code class=''sql''> UPDATE tabelle SET spalte=CONVERT(CONVERT(spalte USING utf8) USING latin1) WHERE xxx_id < xyz,</code>'"

Refer to ''docs.typo3.org'' instead of ''preview.docs.typo3.org''    in the template.    Do not write ''DEFINE SOME TEXTROLES'' any more in each ReST-file.

Would we do that, we would have lost: If we modify usernames, we cannot be sure that there is not another user, who already *has* that username. The two would then no longer be distinguishable. They would appear to be one and the same user.*Solution:*Make the script not fail with a fatal PHP error, but make it fail at least a bit more gracefully:<code class=''php''>$user = User::newFromName( $username ),if ( !is_object( $user ) ) {       echo 'Invalid username. We are sorry, but your username cannot be used by MediaWiki. ' .           'It contains signs/combinations of signs, which cannot be used.',       die(),}$id = $user->idForName(),</code>The script is derived from ''createAndPromote.php'':https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/gitweb?p=mediawiki/core.git,a=blob,f=maintenance/createAndPromote.php,h=81fbbb3d3246042ca671b6c4d0ba3f2a2e0204d1,hb=refs/heads/REL1_21.They basically do the same:<code class=''php''>$user = User::newFromName( $username ),if ( !is_object( $user ) ) {          $this->error( ''invalid username.'', true ),}$exists = ( 0 !== $user->idForName() ),...</code>@$this->error( ''invalid username.'', true ),@ prints the error message and then calls @die()@ as well.'"

The xcache backend implementation is constructed to silently discard any cache operation if in CLI context. That means if Xcache backend is used, it is of no effect in CLI. Furthermore, it is important to set the PHP ini value xcache.var_size to a value (eg. 100M) that is big enough to store the needed data. The usage of this capacity should be monitored.'"

ReST has markup constructs named ''simple table''; ''grid table'' and ''csv-table''. None of them really fit our needs as we have big; largely nested tables in our OpenOffice manuals. Often one table cell contains as much text as it makes a complete document elsewhere.As a possible solution I implemented and proposed an extension to the Docutils (basic ReST tools). Sphinx builds on this and works on top of this. Due to lack of manpower this ''field-list-table'' directive didn't make it into the Docutils core for now and therefore is mostly not available.Now that we have made a lot of progress with the migration process to ReST in the TYPO3 community we see that rendering will be either done on a TYPO3 server or; if locally as well; always by using Sphinx. That is a good thing; as Sphinx offers an API to hook in Sphinx Extensions.The current implementation of the ''field-list-table'' directive is entangled with the classes of the Docutils code. But I should be able to change that.This means:I'll try to rewrite the ''field-list-table'' directive as Sphinx extension and make that available in our Python package ''t3sphinx'' which does what the folder name says: ''ExtendingSphinxForTypo3''.'"

As a consequence, the insecure code is still accessible and a security vulnerability possibly exploitable. The advice should be that the old (possibly insecure) code should be removed as soon as possible.The risk is a little bit lower with TYPO3 extensions, because usually EM takes care about the update and replaces the existing directory of the extension. However, I came across servers in the past, where the admin created a backup of the extension directory before updating the extension. So the extension directory looks like:typoconf/ext/extensionkeytypoconf/ext/extensionkey.baktypoconf/ext/extensionkey.DELETE_ME(or similar)Same issue here... same advice :-)'"

Maybe it would be an idea to add this, as this gives the user a better understanding of how to prevent this.* Often the attacker manipulates PHP files on the server. E.g. inside a PHP file (which might often be the central index.php) he inserts something like @eval(base64_decode(JGPerLmejDnWIMskWmYmz...))@ which is decoded malicius code.* The attackers often gain access to these files via FTP. Stealing FTP credentials can happen by trojans, which may be installed, when the user just visits dangerous sites (gambling, untrustworthy offers for cheap software, porn...) and if he does not use the most up to date version of his browser and/or operating system.* When a FTP account is set up, it is extremely important to specify the directory, which the user should have access to. E.g. if not configured properly, this can easliy default to the root folder of a TYPO3 installation, so that the user cannot only upload files to @fileadmin/@, but so that he can also modify @index.php@ or @typo3conf/localconf.php@. An illegitimate user, who stole the FTP credentials, gains exactly these rights.* Attackers look for code with security issues (e.g. phpmyadmin, forum software, ...)'"

(Or we could just remove it, who needs a secondary skin?)Then the new skin must be set as default in LocalSettings.php.And we must change the default setting for the skin to the name of the new skin for all users, who had selected typo3design before.

They should use an l10n label.common_t3/portalnavigation.php is no longer the same in all skins: typo3vector comes with an own one. Move portalnavigation.php away from common_t3/ into the skin folders. Split up portalnavigation.__i18n__.php into two files and change registration in LocalSettings.php.Make sure that the Piwik Tracking Code (Typo3Design.php, at the end of the HTML structure) also gets part of the new skin.Check the result with the ''W3C Validator'':http://validator.w3.org.

The first thing you see is an advert for an old book. I guess most people do not want to spend 30 ? and wait some days, before they get some information, when they visit the documentation page. Then there are many sections, but e.g. as an absolute beginner, several seem more or less right, but none is the one where you really think: *This* is the *one* for me. Judging it from todays point of view, this section only contains a small fraction of the available ''sources of knowledge''. But the beginner does not know that and the ''Ressources'' section mainly contains broken links (which really creates no good impression). So he most probably does not know where the different sources are and how they are structured. That way he is more or less helpless after scanning through the few texts on there.To improve the situation I would like to update the documentation pages. I think that small changes can already make things noticeably better:On the starting page the advert for that old book should go away. All groups of users should get clear pointers on where to look for what.We should update the ''Ressources'' section. I would replace the broken links with an overview, which lists all the different ressources we have (e.g. newsgroups, documentation extensions in TER, the same documentation in HTML pages on typo3.org, the wiki...) and what they are useful for.

Provided that the inclusion of the locallang file is handled by the language class then your custom file will be included after the real locallang file(s) and the arrays will be merged together. Let's look at an example:ExampleWe want to change the label of the logout button from ''Logout'' to ''End session''. What we do is this:1. First, find out where in the XML code the label is output so that you know the label key and locallang file. In this case the script ''alt_menu.php'' outputs the button which is generated by a function from the file ''class.alt_menu_functions.inc''. Looking into this file we find that the line ''$LANG->sL('LLL:EXT:lang/locallang_core.xml:buttons.logout')'' fetches the label for the button.2. Create an alternative XML file with the labelkeys you want to override (in our case ''buttons.logout''). I have created the file ''typo3conf/langoverride_core.xml'' which looks like this:<?xml version=''1.0'' encoding=''utf-8'' standalone=''yes''><T3locallang>    <data type=''array''>        <languageKey index=''default'' type=''array''>            <label index=''buttons.logout''>End session</label>        </languageKey>        <languageKey index=''dk'' type=''array''>            <label index=''buttons.logout''>Afslut session</label>        </languageKey>    </data></T3locallang>Notice how it contains both an English and Danish label.3. Configure the script to override values in the file ''EXT:lang/locallang_core.xml'' This is simply done by adding an entry in the $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SYS']['locallangXMLOverride'] array which points to the overriding file:$TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SYS']['locallangXMLOverride']['EXT:lang/locallang_core.xml']['myLangOverride'] = 'typo3conf/langoverride_core.xml',The file path of ''typo3conf/langoverride_core.xml'' is relative to the PATH_site constant. You can also keep the file in an extension. In that case you would have to enter the file reference like 'EXT:myext/langoverride_core.xml' - and the file will automatically be found wherever your extension is installed.The name of the array key 'myLangOverride' is arbitrary, but you are advised to give it a meaningful (and unique) value.Additionally in the frontend it is also possible to override labels with the Typoscript key ''_LOCAL_LANG''. This takes precedence over locallangXMLOverride labels.</pre> *Change the word ''XLLfile'' in 2.8 LOCALISATION -> Including locallang files in modules to ''locallangXMLOverride''. *Add the following paragraph somewhere:<pre>Note: Using the array $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['BE']['XLLoverride'] is deprecated and should not be done anymore. $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SYS']['locallangXMLOverride'] is more flexible and also works for the frontend.</pre>'"

Martin Holtz of the docTeam has programmed an openSearch for TYPO3. For those of you who don't know OpenSearch: These are the browsers searches that you find in firefox and IE in the upper right corner. With the TYPO3 search you can search through wiki.typo3.org, the whole extension list on typo3.org, through forge.typo3.org, in TSref, in the API and in the (german) forum at Mittwald Medien. A little example of how to use the search:You just enter ''keyword searchword'' into the input field. Depending on the keyword you change where to look for your searchword. Entering ''ext tt_news'' gets you to the result page you also come to when you search on typo3.org -> Extensions. For an API search it would be e.g. ''api typolink''. If you have multiple words to search for it would be like ''ext news feed'', so the first word is always taken as keyword and all words after that as what you actually want to search. When not using a keyword the search defaults to wiki search.The search even has a nice auto-completion feature for expressions out of the TSref. So if you are not quite sure how an option is spelled you can use that feature to show you. All in all a very nice tool for finding answers to TYPO3 questions. Please note that the whole search tool is in expiremental state, therefore any feedback is appreciated. If you happen to have any questions, positive or negative feedback or anything else you just wish to say do it at the corresponding wiki[1] page. There you can also learn how to install and use the search. ABOUT THE DOCTEAM:The DocTEAM keeps the documentation effort focussed the right way to support documentation-writers. Want to help? Just join us! [2][1] http://wiki.typo3.org/OpenSearch[2] http://forge.typo3.org/projects/show/team-docteamEs gibt eine neue Mˆglichkeit auf die wichtigsten TYPO3-Ressourcen schnell und einfach zuzugreifen. Martin Holtz vom DocTeam hat f¸r TYPO3 eine eigene OpenSearch geschrieben. F¸r alle die jetzt denken ''h‰? OpenSearch???'': OpenSearch, das sind die Browsersuchen, also die Suchen, die im Firefox und im Internet Explorer ¸ber das Suchfeld rechts oben erreichbar sind.‹ber die TYPO3-Suche kˆnnen das TYPO3-Wiki, die Extension-Liste, forge.typo3.org, die TSref, die TYPO3-API und das Forum von Mittwald Medien durchsucht werden.Ein kleines Beispiel:Bei Eingabe von ''ext tt_news'' kommt man auf die gleiche Seite, als h‰tte man unter www.typo3.org auf Extensions geklickt und dann dort ''tt_news'' in das Suchfeld eingegeben. F¸r eine Suche in der API tippt man z.B. ''api typolink''. Weitere Suchwˆrter kˆnnen einfach angehangen werden, zum Beispiel ''ext news feed''. Wird kein Keyword angegeben, sucht man automatisch im Wiki, ist der Suchbegriff in der TSref vorhanden, wird man dorthin weitergeleitet. F¸r Suchbegriffe aus der TSref gibt es sogar automatische Vorschl‰ge, d.h. wenn man sich bei der Schreibweise oder dem genauen Namen nicht ganz sicher ist, hilft die Suche auch dabei. Alles in allem ein nettes Tool, um Suchen und Finden rund um TYPO3 zu beschleunigen.Bitte beachten: Die Suche ist zur Zeit noch im experimentellen Status. Bei Fragen, Anregungen, Lob und Kritik einfach im Wiki[1] melden, dort gibt es auch die Suche inklusive Anleitung.DAS DOCTEAM:Das DocTeam koordiniert die Dokumentationsarbeit und versucht so, f¸r eine bessere, verst‰ndlichere und vollst‰ndigere Dokumentation zu sorgen.

That makes no sense. So I changed the strategy and altered gimmefive to be a bridge to the original source code of FLOW3. There are only a few things left to be done:1) The class t3lib_cs in PHP6/Resources/PHP/class.t3lib_cs.php should be renamed (Issue #651).2) There should be a convenient way to download stable snapshots of the packages FLOW3 and PHP6 as extensions for TYPO3 V4. What do you suggest?3) Caching and Ressource Management is disabled until now but should be enabled. Do you expect any conflicts with TYPO3 V4?4) The AOP Framework is not available until now. Should it be enabled for V4?Comment on 2): Until now I checkout FLOW3 to the root of my web-server and make symbolic links to FLOW3 and PHP6 in typo3conf/ext/.Comment on 2): I have to clarify the things a little bit. FLOW3 (and thus 'gimmefive') requires at least PHP v5.2. You don't have to switch to PHP v6.0. The 'PHP6' named in the manual of 'gimmefive' is only a package of TYPO5 that provides some wrapper classes to get UTF8 strings treated right.'"
