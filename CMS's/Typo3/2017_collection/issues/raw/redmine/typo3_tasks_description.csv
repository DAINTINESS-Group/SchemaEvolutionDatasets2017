=> Content from 5.12. is there.

* Complete content of folder
/var/www/vhosts/wiki.typo3.org 
=> Content from 5.12. is there. Adjustments for new server (server paths, passwords and so on) have been made in these files.

* Complete content of folder
/var/www/vhosts/wiki.typo3.org/www/wiki/images
=> Content from 7.12. is there.
=> If no changes (file uploads!) in the meantime: Ok. Else: Folder images/ (recursively, but only that folder) has to be copied again, to not lose uploads from the meantime

* Database wikitypo3org
=> Get again from old server and put into MySQL again:
     - on old server, User wikitypo3org: mysqldump wikitypo3org --opt > wikidump.sql
     - on new server, User wiki: scp -p wikitypo3org@wiki.typo3.org:~/wikidump.sql wikidump.sql (temporarily needs a private key on the old server)
                                          mysql wiki < wikidump.sql

* After DB wikitypo3org in its final form is there:
TRUNCATE TABLE `msg_resource`,
TRUNCATE TABLE `msg_resource_links`,
TRUNCATE TABLE `objectcache`,
UPDATE `module_deps` SET `md_deps` = REPLACE ( `md_deps`, '/var/www/vhosts/wiki.typo3.org/www/wiki/', '/home/wiki/www/wiki/' ),
(Table module_deps still contains old paths, which would create PHP errors, if not adjusted manually.)

* Database wikidevtypo3org
=> Dev system with old DB ok.

* New DB of the dev system:
UPDATE `module_deps` SET `md_deps` = REPLACE ( `md_deps`, '/var/www/vhosts/wiki.dev.typo3.org/www/wiki/', '/home/wikidev/www/wiki/' ),
=> For the dev system: Done.

* Additional, empty MySQL database is present: MySQL user ""example"" has access to the DB ""example"":
    mysql -u example -pTHEPASSWORD example
    For the password see LocalSettings.php.

* Daily cronjob /etc/cron.d/wiki-backup, add on new system
=> Added in crontab -e, still needs testing, if it's working. Can be done by setting the time in the cronjob line to current time + 1 minute or so.
=> Is working.

* Daily logrotation for the backup files:
/home/wiki/backup/wiki-db.sql.gz
and
/home/wiki/backup/wiki.tar.gz
=> Cannot add that myself: /etc/logrotate.d/wiki: Permission denied.
=> Add by Michi, 5.12. Works.

* Make sure logrotate is configured to use dateext for additions to filenames
=> Already happens by default

* python is there.

* ImageMagick is still missing
=> Install it, preferred location is /usr/bin/convert
=> Has been installed.

* Test upload of an image in the dev system
=> Are thumbnails getting created?
=> Upload and creation of thumbnails are both working

* Logfiles are not all readable.
Adjust owner or permissions of the files in /home/wiki/log and in /home/wikidev/log!

* wikidev: Fix password protection, it is currently set up somewhere with name ""wikidev DEV"". 
Adjust username and password as in /home/wikidev/htaccesspw.txt
   nginx-reload!
   => https://docs.snowflakeops.ch/5-0-stable/services/website.html#environments

* SSO-Code still needed adjustments, because the IP of the server changed.
Folder /home/wiki/tmp/ still had to be created.

* Headlines no longer are styled in Share-Font
The reference in the skin is a relative one, without HTTP/HTTPS.
The problem might be that the backend (the server on which the website is stored, srv179) is called by the proxy server (srv170) via http
internally => http => the proxy encodes this to https
The webserver maybe thinks the request came via http
Solution: Set $wgServer accordingly."
76955;wiki.typo3.org;Task;;Resolved;Should have;Update the Wiki to MediaWiki 1.27;Chris topher;Chris topher;19/12/2016 19:14;;;6/7/2016;;;100;6/7/2016 14:30;;;-805400;;;"Update the Wiki to MediaWiki 1.27

MediaWiki 1.27 has been released and is now available.

h2. Update the server

The update is stalled by the outdated PHP version on the server. Needed is PHP 5.5.9 at least. The update cannot be done before a newer PHP version has been installed. For Debian Squeeze, which is used currently, only PHP 5.4 is available (and also that not from the Debian guys, but only from Dotdeb). PHP 5.5 or newer is not available. Seems like it needs a new OS or a new server.

See #79027.


h2. Update MediaWiki Core and run update.php

Remove old folders (except folder images, our skins and our extensions) and then
cp -r mediawiki-1.27.0/* wiki/
run update.php
=> Done.

(diff mediawiki-1.27.0/ and wiki/).

h2. Update extensions (part 1: extensions from tarball or from mediawiki.org)

h3. Newly bundled for 1.27 (extensions from tarball => update .gitignore)

=> None.

h3. Removed ones (extensions from tarball => update .gitignore)

=> None.

h3. Extensions from mediawiki.org

Update extensions from mediawiki.org.

=> Done.

h2. Relevant changes from the ""mailing list"":https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2016-June/000191.html:

No new details.

https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2016-June/000190.html

* Update index_sso.php according to these changes:
  https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/diffusion/MW/history/REL1_27/maintenance/createAndPromote.php
  (Especially the last 2 ones, where support for AuthManager (namespace MediaWiki\Auth) is added,
  changes e.g. for $user->setPassword($user->randomPassword()),.)
  => setPassword() has been deprecated, pending the introduction of AuthManager.
  => User::randomPassword() is deprecated in favor of a new method
     PasswordFactory::generateRandomPasswordString()
  => Are fixed.

* MediaWiki will now auto-create users as necessary, removing the need for
  extensions to do so. An 'autocreateaccount' right is added to allow
  auto-creation when 'createaccount' is not granted to all users.
  => Check, if this means that new users do not have to be added anymore in index_sso.php
     Maybe they still have to, see createAndPromote.php, which adds them itself.
  => Manually adding them is still needed.

* AuthManager is concerned with logging in by supplying credentials
  to Special:UserLogin or the like, and with creating accounts with
  new credentials. This includes the usual username and password form
  => Does our index_sso.php login script still work?!
  => Creation of new and login of existing accounts?
  => Works.

h2. https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.27:

* PHP extensions openssl and/or(?) mcrypt are required. Otherwise login might fail.
  => Only one of them is needed, see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgSessionInsecureSecrets
  => Checked on the commandline: openssl is present, mcrypt is not. Is ok.
  
h2. RELEASE-NOTES-1.27

* Required PHP extensions
** ctype
** iconv
** json
** mbstring (new requirement in 1.27)
** xml
The following PHP extensions are strongly recommended:
** openssl

=> Checked on the commandline: All present/enabled.

* PHP session handling in general ($_SESSION, session_id(), and so on) is
  deprecated. Use MediaWiki\Session\SessionManager instead.

* Two new globals, $wgChangeCredentialsBlacklist and $wgRemoveCredentialsBlacklist
  can be used to prevent the web UI and the API changing certain authentication data.
  => Check, if otherwise changing the information, which the user should _not_ be able
     to change would be changable and prevent this,
     e.g. the email-address, the real name and the username.
  => And for the API: action=resetpassword
  => Prior to allowing any change, this requires the user to enter his password - which he does not know.
  => Is ok.

* The following functions have been removed:
** wfEmptyMsg() was removed
** wfMsgReal() was removed
** wfMsgHtml() was removed
** wfMsg() was removed
Do we use them? If so, update them to whatever is appropriate, maybe with wfMessage().
For replacements see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Messages_API#Help_with_replacing_deprecated_wfMsg.2A_functions
=> Are not used/fixed. Is ok.

h2. Update our skin

Use diff and adjust... Use Git for version control.
Do the changes from inside the Vector repo:
https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-skins-Vector/

""Old branch."":https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-skins-Vector/commits/REL1_26  ""New branch"":https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-skins-Vector/commits/REL1_27?page=4
Relevant are the commits from where the sha1 hashes for the ""same"" commit start becoming different
First one is 2015-09-23 = Add MediaWiki version requirement to skin.json

* $wgPreloadJavaScriptMwUtil was removed (deprecated in 1.26).
  Extensions, skins, gadgets and scripts that use the mediawiki.util module must
  express a dependency on it.
* $wgIncludeLegacyJavaScript, deprecated in MediaWiki 1.26, now defaults false.
  Extensions, skins, gadgets and scripts that need the mediawiki.legacy.wikibits
  module should express a dependency on it.
  => Relevant for the skins? Searchbox overwrite JavaScript?
  => Is working.
  => Open a few pages and check the console for JS errors!
  => Result: No errors.

* Skins and extensions can now use FlexBox mixins (.flex-display(@display: flex)
  and .flex(@grow: 1, @shrink: 1, @width: auto, @order: 1)) in Less to create
  cross-browser-compatible FlexBox rules. Users will still need to add fallback
  float rules or the like for compatibility with IE9- separately.

* User::getSkin() was removed
  => function getSkin is used in several places, but not the function from inside the User class. Is ok.

* Skin update ready?!
  => Compare with live system and check, if everything still looks the same.
  => Is ok.

=> Use Firebug to check for JavaScript errors and other problems (e.g. missing mediawiki.util)!

* Inside the TOC, there is a new space between classes tocnumber and toctext, which is not underlined.
  These are the 5px, where tocnumber has padding-right: 5px,
  => Fix to make line run through again!
     Untested: #toc ul li, .toc ul li {text-decoration: underline,}
  => Also check typo3design!
  => Is also a problem in Vector and will likely be solved there and can then be integrated for us.

h2. Update CSS file(s) of the TYPO3Design skin

Needs ""update"":http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher?useskin=typo3design

=> Update done. Looks good.

h2. Check list at http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher

=> Done, works.


h2. Check sortable tables

E.g. at http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User_talk:Chrissitopher

=> Is ok.

h2. Other stuff, that needs fixes

* The file typo3conf/ext/ter_fe/res/icons/state_stable.gif
  gets requested from typo3.org by something in the Sandbox page, but the file no longer is there.
  => CSS class ""stable_unreviewed"", used in
     TYPO3ExtensionInfo/entities/T3CMSExtensioninfo.php
     TYPO3ExtensionInfo/renderer/T3CMSExtensionRenderer.php
  => Fixed, uses pure CSS with the original colors from TER now.

* Visiting the Sandbox and clicking around a bit in Firebug under Console > All shows
  a number of deprecated messages. E.g.
  Use of ""gM"" is deprecated. Use mw.message( ... ).parse() instead.
  but there is no backtrace...
  => Source might be a page on the wiki, e.g. MediaWiki:Common.js and friends,
     something in the skin or something in an extension.
  => Might be helpful: Firebug, Script tab, open side panel at the right hand side, see the variables...
  => Search a DB dump for hits of these functions then. The text table might have some...
  => Has also been present in MW 1.26 already, most likely not set by any custom code in our installation.
  => Gets added by the MediaWiki Core, includes/OutputPage.php: getJSVars().

* Integrate the fixes in SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi: SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi again:
  New wheel file and change in SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi.lexers.php.
  See https://forge.typo3.org/issues/71852
  => Done.

* Check Sandbox, e.g. highlighted things and fontsize in section ""Code""...
  => Is ok.

* Check, if the implementation of syntax highlighting for custom tags is still working
  (after GeSHi switched to Pygments)
  => Is working.

* Check, if the Special:Preferences page still is styled, changes were in the commit from 2015-11-08.
  Still untested, if the preferences have not been broken = are still styled at all.
  => Styling is ok.


---

h2. Update extensions (part 2)

h3. Our own, custom extensions

* After looking through some extensions, e.g. Collection, UserMerge, ReplaceText, Poem, Syntaxhighlighting
  there most likely really is exactly nothing to do here. Should all work as is.
  => However, still test the extension functions, e.g. presence of the header on exception pages,
     function of the <extension> and <issue> tags and so on...
  => Are ok.


h3. PDF export feature

Check that HTML in the left-hand menu is displayed as it should. Functionality also still needs a test.
=> After upgrade, test on live system.
=> Menu items are still there, but rendering of a page to PDF fails with
   Book rendering failed: There was an error while attempting to render your book.
   See #79038.

h2. Order columns, remove db dumps in home/

=> Is ok.

h2. Remove mediawiki-1.27.1 and mediawiki-1.27.1.tar.gz in /home/wikidev/www


h2. Copy Git repos and restore content

Move repos (skins, extensions) from dev to live and checkout their content.
=> Done.

h2. Transfer changes in LocalSettings.php to live system!

=> Done.

h2. Add changes in index_sso.php
=> Adding a new user to the DB works. Different passwords set for different users?
=> Changing an existing user's realname also works.
=> Add changes to live instance.
=> Done.

h2. Check, if all pages linked in the main menu do still exist, otherwise update menu accordingly (TYPO3Vector + TYPO3Design)

=> Done.


h2. Create local backup and diff of skin files

E.g.
diff -u Vector/skin.json TYPO3Design/skin.json > Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.27.diff
diff -u Vector/Vector.php TYPO3Design/TYPO3Design.php >> Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.27.diff
diff -u Vector/SkinVector.php TYPO3Design/SkinTYPO3Design.php >> Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.27.diff
diff -u Vector/VectorTemplate.php TYPO3Design/TYPO3DesignTemplate.php >> Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.27.diff

diff -u Vector/skin.json TYPO3Vector/skin.json > Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.27.diff
diff -u Vector/Vector.php TYPO3Vector/TYPO3Vector.php >> Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.27.diff
diff -u Vector/SkinVector.php TYPO3Vector/SkinTYPO3Vector.php >> Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.27.diff
diff -u Vector/VectorTemplate.php TYPO3Vector/TYPO3VectorTemplate.php >> Vector-1.27-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.27.diff


h2. Locally backup SingleSignOn code

=> No longer needed. Is now part of the daily default backup.

h2. diff wiki and wikidev and incorporate all changes

=> Done.

h2. For after the update

* From the Git repos in extensions/ and skins/, do a checkout of branch 1.27.
  In extensions/ download from mediawiki.org.
  => Done.

* index_sso.php: Additional migration tips:

So the general rules for documentation projects are:

- Documentation projects MUST have the right file structure (= canonical, see above)
- For TYPO3 CMS extensions a preprocessor will create that structure ""on the fly"" when there's only a README. That preprocessor already exists.
- For other projects, like Github projects, nothing be rendered at the moment if there only is a README, as we don't have a preprocessor for those projects at the moment.

h2. Update MediaWiki Core and run update.php

Remove old folders (except folder images, our skins and our extensions) and then

run update.php
=> Done.

(diff mediawiki-1.26.0/ and wiki/).

h2. Update extensions (part 1: extensions from tarball or from mediawiki.org)

h3. Newly bundled for 1.26 (extensions from tarball => update .gitignore)

=> None.

h3. Removed ones (extensions from tarball => update .gitignore)

=> None.

h3. Extensions from mediawiki.org

Update extensions from mediawiki.org.

=> Done.

h2. Relevant changes from the ""mailing list"":https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-l/2015-November/045006.html:

No new details.

h2. https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.26:

* Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi has been rewritten and switched from
  the 3rd party library Geshi to the 3rd party library Pygments. If you
  have modified the CSS output with custom rules, these rules might need
  adjustment.
  See also https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ResourceLoader/Migration_guide_%28users%29#Font_mw-geshi
  The mw-geshi, source-css, source-javascript and related classes no
  longer exist. Related code such as the following can be safely removed.
  => Stylesheets updated.

  Page in the MW namespace MediaWiki:Geshi.css: Remove rules from there!
  => Done.
  
h2. RELEASE-NOTES-1.26

* (T99344) The extension.json schema is now versioned. All extensions
  and skins should set a ""manifest_version"" property corresponding to
  the schema version they were written for. The only supported version
  currently is ""1"".
  => Added.
  => Done.

* (T99084) Extensions can now specify what MediaWiki core versions they
  depend upon.
  => Obviously in json files, other extensions don't do that either. Nothing to do.


h2. Update our skin

Use diff and adjust... Use Git for version control.
Do the changes from inside the Vector repo:
https://git.wikimedia.org/log/mediawiki%2Fskins%2FVector.git

""Old branch."":https://git.wikimedia.org/log/mediawiki%2Fskins%2FVector.git/refs%2Fheads%2FREL1_25  ""New branch"":https://git.wikimedia.org/log/mediawiki%2Fskins%2FVector.git/refs%2Fheads%2FREL1_26 
Relevant are the commits after 2015-04-27.
First one is 2015-04-28 = wfRunHooks() -> Hooks::run()

* I.e. (T65198) Talk page tabs now have a ""rel=discussion"" attribute
  => Done.

* On some pages, e.g. on http://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page&action=history
  the text inside the Search box does no longer get replaced by ""Search TYPO3Wiki"".
  JavaScript console shows this error:
  ReferenceError: $ is not defined
  for header.js line 5 and linksupport.js line 9.
  This is the place, where $ is first used, e.g.
  $(document).ready(function ()
  See http://jquery-howto.blogspot.de/2013/02/referenceerror-jquery-is-not-defined.html
  Although jQuery should be included always, the problem is that jQuery is included using the ResourceLoader
  and this is asynchronous since MediaWiki 1.26. jQuery is not yet available when these scripts are run.
  Solution: Put our scripts in an own ResourceLoader module.
  No need to explicitly set jQuery as dependency of this module as jQuery will _then_ be there anyway.
  => Done.

=> Skin update ready!

h2. Update CSS file(s) of the TYPO3Design skin

Needs ""update"":http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher?useskin=typo3design

=> Done.

h2. Check list at http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher

=> Done.


h2. Update extension inclusion in LocalSettings.php

See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension_registration
See also #67178.
=> Collection still missing, rest done.


h2. Other stuff, that needs fixes

* Special:Search needs fix: It now shows page content hits no longer below pages, but displaced and next to them.
  => Done.

* Sandbox, e.g. section ""Code"": Code it too big.
  Was caused by the CSS in the skin (styles for ""pre"").
  => Fixed.


---

h2. Update extensions (part 2)

h3. Our own, custom extensions

* manifest_version in json files
  => Done.

* Update SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi_Typo3WikiExtension
  => Done, see also #71852.


h3. PDF export feature

Check that HTML in the left-hand menu is displayed as it should. Functionality also still needs a test.
=> After upgrade, test on live system.
==> Works, done.



h2. Order columns, remove db dumps in home/

=> Done.

h2. Copy Git repos and restore content

Move repos (skins, extensions) from dev to live and checkout their content.
=> Done.

h2. Transfer changes in LocalSettings.php to live system!

=> Done.

h2. Check, if all pages linked in the main menu do still exist, otherwise update menu accordingly (TYPO3Vector + TYPO3Design)

=> Done.


h2. Create local backup and diff of skin files

E.g.
diff -u Vector/skin.json TYPO3Design/skin.json > Vector-1.26-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.26.diff
diff -u Vector/Vector.php TYPO3Design/TYPO3Design.php >> Vector-1.26-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.26.diff

diff -u Vector/VectorTemplate.php TYPO3Vector/TYPO3VectorTemplate.php >> Vector-1.26-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.26.diff


h2. Locally backup SingleSignOn code

=> Done.

h2. For after the update

* Check, if the implementation of syntax highlighting for custom tags is still working
  (after GeSHi switched to Pygments)
  => PHP, CSS and SQL are still working.
  ==> For TypoScript (<TS> tag) see #71852.

Though this is not too serious at the moment since imho no such extensions are currently providing the ""Edit me on GitHub"" button anyway.

Reported by Thomas Mayer on Slack:

bq. Proof-of-missing-concept for translation of documentation of extensions at https://forge.typo3.org/issues/69080 . More in general this applies for the one-commit-policy which we use for gerrit all over the place (core, extensions, ... and code, documentation). Instead, we should make use of the distribution feature of git, still allowing review/changelog based on merges instead of commits."

<pre>
You need to fork this repository to propose changes.
</pre>

I think it would be better to first show the file before such an action (the fork) is taken. When the file is displayed, there's still an edit button visible in GitHub (""Fork this project and edit the file"").

Reason:

- I guess most users get confused with what GitHub is showing.
- It is unclear to the user if he actually is about to change the right file. Instead, the user should be able to check the content he is about to change.
- Forking a repository is an action with a persistent result which I actually would like to avoid without knowing what I'm doing.

All there is to do would be to change ""/edit/"" to ""/blob/"" in the URL. I think it's the same line as here:

So, there are three options:

# remove the image
# create a generic image
# create/find an image that looks cool

This task is about achieving exactly this. Try option 3) first, if this does not work, try to achieve option 2), if this does not work... well, option 1). If we get more than one suggestion in option 3) or 2), I am happy to put them out for a vote and let everyone in the team provide feedback.

cp -r mediawiki-1.25.0/* wiki/
run update.php

h2. Update extensions (part 1)

h3. Newly bundled for 1.25

=> None.

h3. Extensions from mediawiki.org

Update extensions from mediawiki.org.

=> Done.

h2. Relevant changes from the ""mailing list"":https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-l/2015-May/044396.html:

* Indicators ? Templates that add icons to the top right corner of the page
(and more) can be updated to use the new page status indicators feature.
=> Integrated into skin.

* Enhanced recent changes ? MediaWiki now uses by default the extended
watchlist and so called enhanced recent changes (preference ""Group changes
by page in recent changes and watchlist""), which also received several
improvements in MediaWiki 1.24 and 1.25 (task 37785). This means that
Special:RecentChanges and Special:Watchlist show all the changes to each
page in a given day, sorted by page rather than chronologically. Changes to
each page are collapsed by default and a compact overview is shown, with
links to collated diffs and counts of each user's actions. Full activity
for an individual page can then be shown with a single click. Users will no
longer need to know in detail how a single change was chosen for display in
order to figure out what else may have happened to the page that day, nor
to scan a long list of non-contiguous lines on the screen in order to get a
complete picture. The change is part of MediaWiki's evolution towards an
interface which is more discoverable and less cluttered by default, while
equally easy to quickly access in full, with the help of JavaScript.
However, the (grouped) layout is an improvement for non-JavaScript users as
well.
=> Works.

* Live preview ? While editing, you're not sure what a wikitext syntax will
produce? That's no longer a problem, now that live preview is no longer
experimental. By enabling the feature in your preferences, MediaWiki will
display the effect of your edits without fully reloading the page, so that
you can quickly correct any mistake.
=> Obviously not yet ready as it by default still is disabled. We leave it that way.

h2. https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.25:

* Hitcounter feature has been removed.
=> No replacement available currently, columns removed.

h2. RELEASE-NOTES-1.25

* Update StartProfiler.php:
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Profiling
  => Done.

* MediaWiki now natively supports page status indicators: icons (or short text
  snippets) usually displayed in the top-right corner of the page. They have
  been in use on Wikipedia for a long time, implemented using templates and CSS
  absolute positioning.
  - Basic wikitext syntax: <indicator name=""foo"">[[File:Foo.svg|20px]]</indicator>
  - Usage instructions: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Page_status_indicators
  - Adjusting custom skins to support indicators:
    https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Skinning#Page_status_indicators
	=> Code integrated into our skins.
	==> Position of the indicators (.mw-indicator and .mw-indicators)
	    collided with our language switch.
		Added a margin-right for the indicators so that they are not displayed on top of the language switch.
		Finally, if at least one indicator is present, .mw-body-content gets moved down a bit.
		We will ignore this for now.
		=> Done.

* Deprecated the "".php5"" file extension entry points and the $wgScriptExtension
  configuration variable. Refer to the "".php"" files instead.
  => RewriteRule added.
  => Done.

* The ""temp"" zone of the upload respository is now considered private. If it
  already exists (such as under the images/ directory), please make sure that
  the directory is not web readable (e.g. via a .htaccess file).
  => Deny from all

h2. Check list at http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher

=> All ok.


h2. Update skin inclusion in LocalSettings.php

See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension_registration
=> Done.

h2. Other stuff, that needs fixes

* Functionalities of almost everything (extensions, display of skin...)
  can be checked on page [[Sandbox]].

* TYPO3Vector: line-height of some elements got bigger.
=> Affected ul and dd elements. Fixed.

---

h2. Update extensions (part 2)

h3. Our own, custom extensions

* Update license-name to ""GPL-2.0+"" and adjust COPYING file (new version).

=> Done.

* We are changing the way extensions and skins are registered with MediaWiki.
Extensions and skins can now move their metadata into extension.json or skin.json,
and use wfLoadExtension( 'FooBar' ), or wfLoadSkin( 'FooBar' ), to load those that support it.
All extensions and skins bundled with the tarball support this. The old style of loading
by require_once ""$IP/extensions/FooBar/FooBar.php"", will continue to be supported
for backwards-compatability.
Developer documentation on how to migrate extensions can be found at
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension_registration
=> Extensions converted to extension.json files, still loaded through require_once() calls.
=> Done.




h3. PDF export feature

Check that HTML in the left-hand menu is displayed as it should. Functionality also still needs a test.
=> After upgrade, test on live system.




h2. Order columns, remove db dumps in home/

Table hitcounter is gone,
page: page_counter is gone.
site_stats: ss_total_views is gone.
=> Done.

h2. Commit changes to git repos

Move repos (skins, extensions) from dev to live and restore their content.
=> Done.

h2. Transfer changes in LocalSettings.php to live system!

=> Done.

h2. Check, if all pages linked in the main menu do still exist, therwise update menu accordingly (TYPO3Vector + TYPO3Design)

=> All ok.


h2. Create local backup and diff of skin files

E.g.
diff -u Vector/skin.json TYPO3Design/skin.json > Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.25.diff
diff -u Vector/Vector.php TYPO3Design/TYPO3Design.php >> Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.25.diff
diff -u Vector/SkinVector.php TYPO3Design/SkinTYPO3Design.php >> Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.25.diff
diff -u Vector/VectorTemplate.php TYPO3Design/TYPO3DesignTemplate.php >> Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Design-1.25.diff

diff -u Vector/skin.json TYPO3Vector/skin.json > Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.25.diff
diff -u Vector/Vector.php TYPO3Vector/TYPO3Vector.php >> Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.25.diff
diff -u Vector/SkinVector.php TYPO3Vector/SkinTYPO3Vector.php >> Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.25.diff
diff -u Vector/VectorTemplate.php TYPO3Vector/TYPO3VectorTemplate.php >> Vector-1.25-gegen-TYPO3Vector-1.25.diff

(quote) _Important security related information regarding TYPO3 products or the typo3.org infrastructure are published as so called ""Public Service Announcements"" (PSA). Unlike other advisories, a PSA is usually not accompanied by a software release, but still contain information about how to mitigate a security related issue._

_Topics of these advisories include security issues in third party software like such as Apache, Nginx, MySQL, PHP, etc. that are related to TYPO3 products, possible security related misconfigurations in third party software, possible misconfigurations in TYPO3 products, security related information about the server infrastructure of typo3.org and other important recommendations how to securely use TYPO3 products._

The only type of PSA bulletin I have seen in the last years are security pre-announcements such as TYPO3-PSA-2015-001.

http://typo3.org/teams/security/security-bulletins/psa/typo3-psa-2015-001/

I wonder if we should simplify the paragraphs quoted above and/or move the following sentence into this section:

_For some critical security issues the TYPO3 Security Team may decide to pre-announce a security bulletin on the ""TYPO3 Announce"" mailing list. This is to inform system administrators about the date and time of an upcoming important bulletin, so that they can schedule the update._"

Nothing is wrong with that, but I wonder if we should expand the code example, so that is also covers strings in GET/POST requests and also describe to parse/inject the argument properly and securily.

I am thinking about a code fragment, Jigal van Hemert posted in the English mailing list [2] in December 2014:

<pre>lib.products = CONTENT
lib.products{
	table = TABLE
	select {
		selectFields = name
		pidInList = 26506
		orderBy = name
		where = sid like ###GPSID###
		markers {
			GPSID.data = GP:SID
		}
	}
	renderObj = COA
	renderObj {
		10  = COA
		10  {
			10 = TEXT
			10.dataWrap ={field:name}[\n]
		}
	}
}</pre>

If someone is interested and has the time to re-work the code snippet and add the ""argument as string"" example, knock yourself out :-)
The main point of the code above is that by using markers, values get escaped and quoted automatically if required.

h2. Relevant changes from the ""mailing list"":https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-l/2014-November/043650.html:

All good.

h2. https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.24:

* Redirect to Special:UserLogin when logging in is required to proceed, instead of showing an error message
=> E.g. http://wiki.typo3.org/Special:Watchlist
=> Redirects to http://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Special%3AWatchlist&returntoquery=&warning=watchlistanontext
=> Update .htaccess redirect so that these URLs are redirected to typo3.org as well!
=> Added this RewriteRule:
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} (?:^|&)title=Special:UserLogin(?:&|$) [NC]
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} (?:^|&)returnto=([^&]+) [NC]
RewriteRule index\.php$ https://typo3.org/my-account/sso/wiki/?returnTo=%1 [R=301,L]
==> Done.

* https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T41035
Improved Vector skin performance by removing collapsibleNav, which used to collapse some sidebar elements by default. This removes -list id suffixes like p-lang-list: instead of using things like #p-lang-list, you can do #p-lang .body ul. If you would like CollapsibleNav back please use the CollapsibleVector extension.
=> Done.

* Upgrade jQuery to version 1.11.x
=> JavaScript things in skin still working?
==> Is ok.

* File Wiki.php is missing => Has been renamed to MediaWiki.php, see https://git.wikimedia.org/commit/mediawiki%2Fcore.git/aef531f6d4b8eea10a35e2ee4f9bb522665867fa
=> Login works without it as well, but it is referenced in index_sso.php.
==> Fixed.

* Password hashes will automatically be updated as users log in. In addition, there is a maintenance script wrapOldPasswords.php that can wrap all passwords in PBKDF2 (or the hashing algorithm of your choice) if you don't want to wait for your users to log in.
=> Documentation is badly incomplete. Types might be explained in http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgPasswordConfig
=> Do later, issue created: https://forge.typo3.org/issues/63830
=> Done.


h2. RELEASE-NOTES-1.24

* The legacy '''skins/common/''' directory has been emptied and deleted as part of the skin system cleanup. Files that have been present in it have been moved elsewhere or deleted (if they were unused). If you loaded any of these files as part of your custom skin or on-wiki CSS/JS, you should make a copy of the old files in a non-MediaWiki directory.
 - skins/common/commonElements.css  -> 'mediawiki.skinning.elements' module
 - skins/common/commonContent.css   -> 'mediawiki.skinning.content' module
 - skins/common/commonInterface.css -> 'mediawiki.skinning.interface' module
=> The skin uses the modules and no longer accesses the files directly.
=> Is Ok.

h2. Update our skin

First one is 2014-04-10 = Remove #bodyContent { width: 100%, }
=> All done.

And then continue with the changes from inside the separate Vector repo:
https://git.wikimedia.org/log/mediawiki%2Fskins%2FVector.git/refs%2Fheads%2FREL1_24
=> Done.

For updates needed for skin autodiscovery see forge #59311.
=> Done.

Change the resourceLoader registration of our skin (again)...
=> LocalSettings.php/ main skin file! Like vector... 
==> Done.

On http://wiki.typo3.org/MediaWiki:Geshi.css
=> Replace all occurrences of #bodyContent with .mw-body-content - also the one in the comment!
=> Done, but STILL TODO IN LIVE SYSTEM (see changes from December 8th)!
==> Done.

WikiEditor toolbar in TYPO3Vector skin again has blue background.
=> On [[MediaWiki:TYPO3Vector.css]] update casing in the path inside the rule from ""typo3vector"" to ""TYPO3Vector""!
=> Done, but STILL TODO IN LIVE SYSTEM (see changes from December 8th)!
==> Done.

Input fields have nasty orange border, e.g. on the special page ""Move page""...
=> Skin update did not fix this. Affects multiline and oneline fields.
=> Caused by .mw-ui-input:focus from components/typo3*.less.
=> Defined in MediaWiki in resources/src/mediawiki.ui/components/input.less.
==> Seems to overwrite the complete content of the file, which is not wanted. Solution?
===> See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgResourceModuleSkinStyles
==> Done.

Input-Felder in TYPO3Design OK?
==> Affected the same way as above.
==> Done.

h2. Update CSS file(s) of the TYPO3Design skin

Needs ""update"":http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher?useskin=typo3design
=> Done.

h2. Check list at http://wiki.dev.typo3.org/User:Chrissitopher

All fine, except this one:
File upload seems to work, but throws this error multiple times:
Warning: is_executable(): open_basedir restriction in effect. File(/bin/bash) is not within the allowed path(s): (list of paths) in includes/GlobalFunctions.php on line 2809
=> Related to thumbnail creation? (Thumbnails did get created...)
==> Workaround: Discussed with the Server Team in ""[Ticket#2014121074000321] Configuration change for the wiki server""
===> Added /bin to open_basedir, documented in https://forge.typo3.org/issues/63819.
===> Done.
==> In order to also work without this config change, this issue aims to fix the problem in MediaWiki: https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T78159
==> Works for us. Done.

h2. Update skin inclusion in LocalSettings.php

#Like so: require_once ""$IP/skins/Vector/Vector.php"",
=> Do that with our skins (and with Vector, which was in wgSkipSkins, but _was_ installed and usable by useskin=vector).
==> Done.

h2. Other stuff, that needs fixes

Main page, box with links to Neos stuff has different line height.
=> .t3sidebar p gives wrong size after #content no longer kicks in.
==> Fixed.

---

h2. Update extensions

h3. Newly bundled for 1.24

None.

=> Done.


h2. For after the update

New special page, MyLanguages, to redirect users to subpages with localised versions of a page. (Integrated from Extension:Translate)
=> Alternative to our translation system?
==> All unused anyway.

* Most usual conditions for specific browsers can nowadays turned into

This way you could even do things like

60828;Documentation Rendering;Task;;Resolved;Should have;Add styling for the left hand side menu in the singlehtml version;Chris topher;Chris topher;6/8/2014 19:23;;;6/8/2014;;;100;6/8/2014 19:07;;;-27600;;;"I had a look at the singlehtml/ version of the manuals and I saw that the left hand side menu is still broken.

I have tested the problem and I think this can be fixed by ?simply? adding the correct ids/classes to the HTML code (with other words: the CSS needed for the styling is already there and no change is needed at that point).

In the ?ordinary? page versions (e.g. http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/InstallationGuide/ ) this is what the HTML code looks like:

<pre>
<ul id=""nav-aside"" class=""cnt-2"">
<li class=""toctree-l1 nav-aside-lvl1 cnt-3"">
<a class=""cnt-5 nav-aside-lvl1 reference internal"" href=""Introduction/Index.html"">Introduction</a>
</li>
<li class=""toctree-l1 nav-aside-lvl1 cnt-6"">
<a class=""cnt-8 nav-aside-lvl1 reference internal"" href=""QuickInstall/Index.html"">Introduction</a>
</li>
</pre>
The result of this HTML is styled correctly.


In the singlehtml/ version however, (e.g. http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/InstallationGuide/singlehtml/ ) this in contrast is the HTML code (note the missing classes):
<pre>
<ul>
<li class=""toctree-l1"">
<a class=""reference internal"" href=""Index.html#document-Introduction/Index"">Introduction</a>
</li>
<li class=""toctree-l1"">
<a class=""reference internal"" href=""Index.html#document-QuickInstall/Index"">Quick Installation</a>
</li>
</pre>
The result is unstyled.

I could fix this by adding exactly three things:
Add to the ul tag: id=""nav-aside"" and
Add to each li tag the class: ""nav-aside-lvl1"" and
Add to each a tag the class: ""nav-aside-lvl1""

Where and how must these changes be integrated in order to by default become part of all newly generated singlehtml/ versions?

from Jochen Rau in 5-mailing-list:

as I started to integrate the Package Manager of FLOW3 in 'EXT:gimmefive' (see http://forge.typo3.org/projects/show/extension-gimmefive) I realized that I'm on my way to backport almost the whole source code of FLOW3. That makes no sense. So I changed the strategy and altered gimmefive to be a bridge to the original source code of FLOW3. There are only a few things left to be done:

1) The class t3lib_cs in PHP6/Resources/PHP/class.t3lib_cs.php should be renamed (Issue #651).
2) There should be a convenient way to download stable snapshots of the packages FLOW3 and PHP6 as extensions for TYPO3 V4. What do you suggest?
3) Caching and Ressource Management is disabled until now but should be enabled. Do you expect any conflicts with TYPO3 V4?
4) The AOP Framework is not available until now. Should it be enabled for V4?

Comment on 2): Until now I checkout FLOW3 to the root of my web-server and make symbolic links to FLOW3 and PHP6 in typo3conf/ext/.

Comment on 2): I have to clarify the things a little bit. FLOW3 (and thus 'gimmefive') requires at least PHP v5.2. You don't have to switch to PHP v6.0. The 'PHP6' named in the manual of 'gimmefive' is only a package of TYPO5 that provides some wrapper classes to get UTF8 strings treated right."

* fixed typo (thanks to Georg Ringer)
* added TYPO3-logo, chapter-number and chapter-title to the header, for better orientation
* TYPO3-coloring scheme
* added hyperlinking to the TOC (yeah!)
* added PDF as example for the TOC-linking
* Font Tahoma (if you don't use it a good alternative font will be used)

If you have any change requests put it in http://bugs.typo3.org bugtracker / documentation with title prefix ""doc_template"".

We will use this layout for the core-documents, too, but updating will take some days ... or weeks.

Cheers!

There is a new possibility to access the most important TYPO3 resources. Martin Holtz of the docTeam has programmed an openSearch for TYPO3. For those of you who don't know OpenSearch: These are the browsers searches that you find in firefox and IE in the upper right corner. 

With the TYPO3 search you can search through wiki.typo3.org, the whole extension list on typo3.org, through forge.typo3.org, in TSref, in the API and in the (german) forum at Mittwald Medien. 

A little example of how to use the search:
You just enter ""keyword searchword"" into the input field. Depending on the keyword you change where to look for your searchword. Entering ""ext tt_news"" gets you to the result page you also come to when you search on typo3.org -> Extensions. For an API search it would be e.g. ""api typolink"". If you have multiple words to search for it would be like ""ext news feed"", so the first word is always taken as keyword and all words after that as what you actually want to search. When not using a keyword the search defaults to wiki search.

The search even has a nice auto-completion feature for expressions out of the TSref. So if you are not quite sure how an option is spelled you can use that feature to show you. All in all a very nice tool for finding answers to TYPO3 questions. 

Please note that the whole search tool is in expiremental state, therefore any feedback is appreciated. If you happen to have any questions, positive or negative feedback or anything else you just wish to say do it at the corresponding wiki[1] page. There you can also learn how to install and use the search.

Es gibt eine neue Mglichkeit auf die wichtigsten TYPO3-Ressourcen schnell und einfach zuzugreifen. Martin Holtz vom DocTeam hat fr TYPO3 eine eigene OpenSearch geschrieben. Fr alle die jetzt denken ""h? OpenSearch???"": OpenSearch, das sind die Browsersuchen, also die Suchen, die im Firefox und im Internet Explorer ber das Suchfeld rechts oben erreichbar sind.

ber die TYPO3-Suche knnen das TYPO3-Wiki, die Extension-Liste, forge.typo3.org, die TSref, die TYPO3-API und das Forum von Mittwald Medien durchsucht werden.

Ein kleines Beispiel:
Bei Eingabe von ""ext tt_news"" kommt man auf die gleiche Seite, als htte man unter www.typo3.org auf Extensions geklickt und dann dort ""tt_news"" in das Suchfeld eingegeben. Fr eine Suche in der API tippt man z.B. ""api typolink"". Weitere Suchwrter knnen einfach angehangen werden, zum Beispiel ""ext news feed"". Wird kein Keyword angegeben, sucht man automatisch im Wiki, ist der Suchbegriff in der TSref vorhanden, wird man dorthin weitergeleitet. 

Fr Suchbegriffe aus der TSref gibt es sogar automatische Vorschlge, d.h. wenn man sich bei der Schreibweise oder dem genauen Namen nicht ganz sicher ist, hilft die Suche auch dabei. Alles in allem ein nettes Tool, um Suchen und Finden rund um TYPO3 zu beschleunigen.

Bitte beachten: Die Suche ist zur Zeit noch im experimentellen Status. Bei Fragen, Anregungen, Lob und Kritik einfach im Wiki[1] melden, dort gibt es auch die Suche inklusive Anleitung.

DAS DOCTEAM:
Das DocTeam koordiniert die Dokumentationsarbeit und versucht so, fr eine bessere, verstndlichere und vollstndigere Dokumentation zu sorgen. Ihr mchtet helfen? Dann macht einfach mit! [2]

I wrote a sniff which looks for debug functions like debug(), t3lib_div::debug(), print_r(), var_dump() and xdebug(). It found also such function even if they are commented out.

Cover page:
- Year 2010 --> 2011.
- Fix version number to be 4.5.0 (cover page), leave em_conf for upload to TER.

Introduction:
- Add lines on 4.5:
@
For TYPO3 4.5 some checkboxes at the bottom of modules were made hidable. This applies to the options at the bottom of the list and the filelist module as well as to the checkbox ""Show secondary options"". Some settings concerning TCEforms were added. FlexForms are editable via TSconfig and group access lists now. TYPO3 4.5 comes with a new taskcenter - the according documentation was added. Another important change is that beginning with TYPO3 4.5 the word ""shortcut"" is only used for a shortcut to another page and no longer where ""bookmark"" was meant. Therefore the according options were renamed. So for example ""enableShortcuts"" is now called ""enableBookmarks"" and so on. 
@
- Remove note on new template
- Change link to the wiki page with the changes. It should be called something with 4.4 and 4.5

Content:
- Somewhere it says ""Testsite"" Package. Not sure if that really means this really old thing. However, use Introduction Package instead.
- In the description of [tablename].[field].[dataStructKey].[flexSheet]:
?Configuration for the data structure of a _field_ with type ""flex"".?
should be
?TCEFORM.[tablename].[field].[dataStructKey].[flexSheet] configures a whole FlexForm sheet.?
- Add/change the properties as needed. ""See the Pending Documentation page"":http://wiki.typo3.org/Pending_Documentation.
Test each of them, if
-- it works as described
-- the description is clear.

Form:
- Adjust width of columns (leave table width unchanged) where needed.

  lib.Gifbuild = IMAGE
  lib.Gifbuild.file = GIFBUILDER
  lib.Gifbuild.file {
    offset=10,15
    XY = 500,350

    10.shadow.intensity = 100
    10.shadow.offset = 10,10
  }
</pre>
But the resulting shadow is not grey, but still black (which is the default). Does someone see a mistake I made?

These strings are used for internal purposes, e.g. the first one shows a link ""More information in the text of Timer frequency"". The second one includes two images from the folder wizard_sortpages...

The problem is that people obviously don't know the meaning of these internal strings. We see on the Translation Server that they try to translate them as a sentence.

This will break the context sensitive help. You will e.g. get non-existing images and broken ?More information? links.

Configuration like this belongs into TS, not into language labels. It is really bad use of l10n.

We cannot remove the ones which are already there, but we can at least prevent new ones from being added.

So:
Add a note that such strings in language labels are *not allowed*."

This is not desired.

OpenOffice does not show headlines there, but normal paragraphs. They also do not appear in the TOC inside OpenOffice. Their headline styling is not activated in OpenOffice and cannot be changed there.

However, .sxw files are just .zip files. Inside the .sxw file there is a file called ""content.xml"", which contains the text of the document including all style commands.

At the places where we get our ""phantom headlines"" in TER, there everytime should be a normal paragraph, but instead there in fact is a headline(!) element with a specified text-level:
<code class=""xml"">
<text:h text:style-name=""P9"" text:level=""2""/>
</code>

I now replaced each of them with an empty paragraph:
<code class=""xml"">
<text:p text:style-name=""Standard""/>
</code>
This is used that way for empty paragraphs at other places, too, and there it does not cause this problem.

The wiki should then be updated to that new design. We should then create a new skin. It should be based on the vector skin in the version, which is current for our MediaWiki version. (And not based on the TYPO3Skin, as there were many changes in MediaWiki, which improve e.g. caching (RessourceLoader) and our old skin does not yet take advantage of them.)

The old skin (""typo3design"") can stay. (Or we could just remove it, who needs a secondary skin?)
Then the new skin must be set as default in LocalSettings.php.
And we must change the default setting for the skin to the name of the new skin for all users, who had selected typo3design before. This can be done with the ""maintenance script userOptions.php"":http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Skin_configuration#Set_a_Default_Skin_for_a_Wiki.

An own mwsuggest.js is no longer needed. Remove the file and the reference. We have just overwritten everything, which came with the old file (which still was included all the time). No reference has been removed, which had to be added now.

Take the contents of ""MediaWiki:Typo3design.css"":http://wiki.typo3.org/MediaWiki:Typo3design.css and readjust them for the new skin.

Make sure the files in the folder typo3vector/ are up to date with the MediaWiki release 1.19. E.g. vector.js might still be there in an old version.

Make sure the words ""and you can edit"" are not hardcoded in the header of the page (login). They should use an l10n label.

common_t3/portalnavigation.php is no longer the same in all skins: typo3vector comes with an own one. Move portalnavigation.php away from common_t3/ into the skin folders. Split up portalnavigation.__i18n__.php into two files and change registration in LocalSettings.php.

Make sure that the Piwik Tracking Code (Typo3Design.php, at the end of the HTML structure) also gets part of the new skin.

""I've been exploring the various doc sites, and am wondering about the division of information between them. There seems to be much duplicate information. For example, the wiki often seems to contain information that belongs in the manuals.""

We should (re)define, what we want to have the wiki for.
You name *extension manuals*, I can add *official documents* like TSref and TSconfig, where there are copies in the Wiki. 
For some of those documents translations have been created (which is a good thing).
But their problem is, that they are not the most current versions and that noone updates even the English texts. The translations first are based on the old English text and second are often incomplete.
*For the official documents* I propose to write the main authors of the wiki translations and to integrate them into our official forge projects. They should do their translations there (as we do that already for many translations).

*For the other manuals* we won't care for them. Maybe it's an idea to leave them in the Wiki...?

===
This extensions checks the Web site for malicious code that may have been injected. In the majority of hacking attempts the hacker tries to include foreign code in the site that will be executed whenever the page is requested.

Most of these hacking attempts are done with automated scripts that scan a server for index.php, index.html and index.htm pages and insert additional code into these.

Since in TYPO3 all page requests go through the index.php file in the root directory any additional code in this file will be executed with every page request.

The extension checkmysite is analyzing the content of this index.php and checks for any malicious code. If any suspicious code is found, a set of predefined actions can be taken.

While this extension will not discover every hacking attempt of a website, it will discover dangerous modifications of the index.php file which accounts for 90-95% of all hacking attacks.

But it does not tell, how such an attack can look like and how it can happen. Maybe it would be an idea to add this, as this gives the user a better understanding of how to prevent this.

* Often the attacker manipulates PHP files on the server. E.g. inside a PHP file (which might often be the central index.php) he inserts something like @eval(base64_decode(JGPerLmejDnWIMskWmYmz...))@ which is decoded malicius code.
* The attackers often gain access to these files via FTP. Stealing FTP credentials can happen by trojans, which may be installed, when the user just visits dangerous sites (gambling, untrustworthy offers for cheap software, porn...) and if he does not use the most up to date version of his browser and/or operating system.
* When a FTP account is set up, it is extremely important to specify the directory, which the user should have access to. E.g. if not configured properly, this can easliy default to the root folder of a TYPO3 installation, so that the user cannot only upload files to @fileadmin/@, but so that he can also modify @index.php@ or @typo3conf/localconf.php@. An illegitimate user, who stole the FTP credentials, gains exactly these rights.

Solution: 
Use salted hashes. Doing so produces different hashes for the same password.
In TYPO3 the system extension ""saltedpasswords"" can do that.

To use this extension, the password must be transfered in clear text.
To prevent the password being spied on the way through the internet, you should use a secure channel to transfer the password.
To do so, you have 2 possibilities: Make sure that your site is only available via SSL. If you cannot do that, you should use the system extension ""rsaauth"", which basically works like SSL."

Since TYPO3 4.6 we also have XLIFF files. Their structure should also be explained.

---

Here is an example file, locallang.xlf:
<code class=""XML"">
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
<xliff version=""1.0"">
	<file source-language=""en"" datatype=""plaintext"" original=""messages"" date=""2011-10-18T18:20:51Z"" product-name=""my-ext"">
		<header/>
		<body>
			<trans-unit id=""headerComment"" xml:space=""preserve"">
				<source>The default Header Comment.</source>
			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id=""generator"" xml:space=""preserve"">
				<source>The ""Generator"" Meta Tag.</source>
			</trans-unit>
		</body>
	</file>
</xliff>
</code>

---

Also explain, how a translated version looks like.
Basically it is the same as the English file with the following changes:
* file name: short version of the name of the language is prepended, e.g. de.locallang.xlf
* content:
** file tag: target-language=""de"" added
** for each source tag: Add a ""target"" sibling
** Put the translation inside the target tag.

Here is a translation of the example from above. It must then be called de.locallang.xlf:
<code class=""XML"">
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
<xliff version=""1.0"">
	<file source-language=""en"" target-language=""de"" datatype=""plaintext"" original=""messages"" date=""2011-10-18T18:20:51Z"" product-name=""my-ext"">
		<header/>
		<body>
			<trans-unit id=""headerComment"" xml:space=""preserve"">
				<source>The default Header Comment.</source>
				<target>Der Standard-Header-Kommentar.</target>
			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id=""generator"" xml:space=""preserve"">
				<source>The ""Generator"" Meta Tag.</source>
				<target>Der ""Generator""-Meta-Tag.</target>
			</trans-unit>
		</body>
	</file>
</xliff>
</code>



Difference to XML files: Only one translation possible per file. For multiple languages, you need multiple files.

I know exactly what you mean. However, we can not be 100% sure that every extension developer follows our policies. Ignoring this fact (and not dealing with it in the Security Guide) would inappropriate, too.

In an ideal world, all developers follow the policies but this is theoretical only and can not be guaranteed. The practical way is to keep extensions up-to-date or (and this is what I explicitly stated in the document):

""...updating extensions whenever a new version was published is a good idea in general - at least the consideration of it.""

This issue was discussed earlier in #31257 where Helmut agreed to this statement. Obviously, this is really a sensible topic :-)

The list starts with the least feasible possibility, and goes on to the best case scenario. This leaves a negative impression in the mind of the reader. I can imagine that it might be possible that in most cases, developers fail to respond. Still, I think that the order should be reversed to start with the most positive case: ""the developer responds and delivers a fix"".

Under General Information->Difference between core and extensions: ""Since everybody can submit extensions to the TER, the code quality varies greatly. Some extensions show a very high level of code quality, while others have been written by amateurs. Most of the known security issues in TYPO3 have been found in these extensions, which are not part of the core system. *Therefore, this does not imply that TYPO3 is insecure in general. It is possible, that none of these issues are related to TYPO3 itself but have been found in extensions.*""

I think the bold sentences put too much emphasis on vulnability of extensions. It is probably true that there are more vulnerabilities found in extensions than in the core, and I agree that the reader should be made aware of that fact. But even without the bold part, this message is conveyed. In my opinion the bold part is too defensive and sounds a bit like ""hey, dont look at us, it's those amateur extension writers who are the bad guys!"""

Since the update to MediaWiki 1.18 these tables do not display correctly anymore (see above example): The first row _below_ the actual header is displayed as if it was a header row, too.

Obviously the HTML structure of tables has changed. The example table now uses this nesting of tags:
<pre>
table - thead - tr - th
      - tbody - tr - td <-- This one looks like a header cell, but should not!
                   - td

CSS definitions like this one cause the problem:
<code class=""css"">
table.usertable th, table.usertable tr:first-child td {
  background-color: #F8C464,
}</code>

We sometimes see that system administrators update the TYPO3 core because of a security issue by extracting the new TYPO3 sources, changing the symlink but leaving the sources of the previous TYPO3 version on the system. As a consequence, the insecure code is still accessible and a security vulnerability possibly exploitable. The advice should be that the old (possibly insecure) code should be removed as soon as possible.

The risk is a little bit lower with TYPO3 extensions, because usually EM takes care about the update and replaces the existing directory of the extension. However, I came across servers in the past, where the admin created a backup of the extension directory before updating the extension. So the extension directory looks like:

typoconf/ext/extensionkey
typoconf/ext/extensionkey.bak
typoconf/ext/extensionkey.DELETE_ME
(or similar)

Same issue here... same advice :-)

<pre>
The class name is expected to follow some conventions. The namespace and path parts (see ?Namespaces? on page 8) are all lowercase and separated by underscores (?_?). At the end comes the ?true? class name which must be written in upper camel case.
Taking again the example of file class.t3lib_cache_backend_abstractbackend.php, the PHP class declaration will look like:
</pre>

In fact the namespaces are separated by one slash (""\"") and uppercase letters are allowed."
